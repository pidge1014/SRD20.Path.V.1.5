This game will be exalted 3rd ed as written, with some setting specific terminology and additions, but only one change.
A character is attuned to any element associated with the energy of their core.  The typical core of a member of the Wei clan, for example, is developed by gathering the energy of the air at dawn, when it is full of dreams and new light.  They are considered both an air and fire character.

For characters built in the first session, you were born into one of the three Clans living in Sacred Valley:  Kazan, Wei, and Li Clan.  
Everyone here grows up learning to harness their essence and abilities, to help and improve their clan.
Characters will be using the 'Just Hatched' rules. 

As one develops and advances in age, they progress through the 3 stages of advancement:  
Copper, at which stage you learn to feel and harness the madra in the environment around you.  
Iron, where the energy you have accumulated in your core reshapes your body. 
And, the greatest of the clans elders may one day reach the ranks of Jade, where their spiritual core is strengthened beyond compare.
Ancient rumors speak of an advancement past jade, but anyone able to achieve that would have certainly united sacred valley long ago and it remains very splintered.

Characters will be 17-29 years old and at Iron advancement.  As a iron, you can sense the energy in world, and have been cycling it into your core ever since copper.

* **Clan options:**
* Li: (Wood/Water) The Li clan live along the Dragon river, in the shadows of the forest under the great moutain known as The Greatfather.  Their clan emblem is a snake in a tree, and they have a stronger connection to nature, and the sacred beasts that live their, than either of the other clans.  The Li clan also have the greatest concern with outward apeparances and self care, chosing to always be decorated in the most expensive jewelery their family could afford.
Their techiniques are often fluid and they mirror their movements with that of a stricking snake.  While their attacks often lack the physical strength of the Kazan clan, the poison it leaves behind is more than sufficient to bring their opponents to their knees.
The Li clan are the strongest soul smiths in the valley, and can craft many great things from the remanants of sacred beasts and artists alike.

* Wei: (Air/Fire) Living under the strange ring of lights that surround Mt Samara, which provide propetual twighlight throughout the evening, the Wei techniques use the Dream and Light madra that permiates through the air.  Their charms often take the form of a seven tailed fox, the ancient sacred beast the clan's techniques come from.  Illusions are employed often, although their enemies often find themselves burned to ash when they discover some of these manifestations carry real power.
When employed on the battlefield, the Wei clan refer to their Path of illusion and fire as the Path of the White Fox. 
The Wei may appear to be the poorest of the clans, and while that may be true, they are also by far the most pragmatic.  After all, what value is a jewel if you can create illusions far for stunning at will.
They measure their worth in their ability to make dramatic and memorable illusions, and as such, spending resources on extravagant physical possessions is an unnessessary extravagance.  Their houses are simple, but their cities protective wards are amoung the best in the valley.

* Kazan: (Fire/Earth) The Kazan have mined Mt venture for ages, as it possesses veins of half-silver and other natural minerals of great value.  They are a proud and stuborn people.  Their crafting tradition, is equally as old and they take great pride in their quality, and supply, of weapons and armor.
Their traditional Path can be used as one of creation or destruction, depending on the will of the user.  They are able to manipulate, manifest, and even embody earth and stone.  Their sacred artists have been known to be as immovable as a mountain, and as deadly as an erupting volcano.
The Kazan have a great wealth of half-silver and goldsteel, and they show it off as often as possible.  The badges they wear to state their rank, for example, are oversized and almost as useful as a breastplate.  Their cities are equally as extravagant and their buildings are the most impressive in all of sacred valley.
Even the great schools on the mountains around sacred valley value their students from the Kazan clan to build and maintain their structures.

*Alternate aspects and Cores* :  Your Core is where your power comes from, and typically represents an unaltered source of natural Madra.  The Wei Clan, for example, refer to their core as a White Fox core, but it is in truth the emodyment of the dream and light energy that their homes are bathed in each morning. There are many types of Madra in the greater world, and once your become a copper and can absorb the madra of the outside world, your core will become attuned to one source.

*Recharging Essence (Madra)* : In addition to regaining essence per the normal rules, it is possible to channel ambient energy that matches your characters core.  It is also possible to leverage available essence directly from the environment.
In order to recharge your essence, you must cycle the ambient energy into your core.  When you spend essence, you are channeling madra from your core to power your charm.  Cycling ambient energy back into your core rewards you a number of essence points equal to what the game master says is available in the area.  It can be close to 0 or more madra then you can spend per round, depending on the environment.
You can, in fact, create an environment that generates the energy you need.   Should you have a fire aspected core, sitting or fighting by a campfire would allow you access to fire madra.
Apart from a setting that is naturally producing madra compatable with your own, natural treasures can also be used to both recharge and advance your core. It is said that a sacred fruit, refined by a sufficiently skilled artist, can bring someone from copper to jade.   Certainly such rumors are nonsense.

* Unaspected Charms :  Your unaspected charms still manifest with the elements associated with your core.  This very likely has not just a visual change, but a change in effect.   For example, a core of sword madra isn't going to aid a sword users body in the same way an earth core would aid their body.  Charms will typically work as written, but may have additional effects or situations where they are especially useful.
