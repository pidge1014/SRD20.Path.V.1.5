**Servant of the Deep**

Sailors of the Oceans have long known to keep land in sight and have many stories for what happens to those who break this rule.  But while most know the deep ocean holds unparalleled dangers, only the extremely foolish seek out the knowledge of what lurks below.  

Those who do, and succeed in finding answers, soon discover they have lost themselves on the way.

Requirement:

Member of the Cult of the Deep Ones

or

Must have access to a forbidden book of knowledge relating to the Deep Ones.  The book does not need to be decoded to begin progressing in this class.

**Alignment:**  Any.

Added Class skills:**  Knowledge (Deep Old Ones)

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 5 + [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)** modifier.

|10th|10|+7|+7|+7|Forbidden Knowledge 3, Alignment Shift|


**Forbidden Knowledge 1:**  You have learned incredible things in your study and while you can't explain it, you have memories and abilities that seem foreign to you.  You may gain any feat for which you do not meet one prerequisite, but meet all others.

Forbidden Knowledge 2 and 3 function as Forbidden Knowledge 1, but allow you to ignore 2 and 3 feat prerequisites respectively.

**Insanity:** As your knowledge grows with the unexplained, you can feel it beginning to break your mind apart. Roll a d100 against the below table and gain that disability permanently.  This can be removed via the normal magical means, but any forbidden knowledge gained at the same level as the insanity is lost.  If you receive the same madness twice, the condition intensifies(or happens again, in case of amnesia) and any associated save increases by 2.


|**d%**|**Insanity**|

|85–100|[Schizophrenia](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/madness/schizophrenia)|


**Alignment Shift:** As your knowledge grows, it becomes apparent the very things you are studying are taking hold of your mind.  Your alignment shifts one step towards Chaotic.  If you are already Chaotic, it shifts one step towards Evil.   

If you are already chaotic evil, the darkness smiles at you and rewards you with an additional forbidden knowledge.

If this alignment shift is corrected via magic or good/lawful deeds, any forbidden knowledge gained at the same time as an alignment shift is lost.

**Monkey Wrangler**

Of all the wild animals that have been tamed, perhaps none are more impressive than the wranglers of the western rim's mastery of the devil monkey.  

Devil Monkey's were first raised to assist the local dwarves with collecting the annual fruit harvest.  At first, the dwarves simply played off the monkey's natural behavior.  When threatened, they would throw what they had on hand.  If you are foolish enough to threaten one in a rock quarry, it will be a bad day for you; but, if you threaten one in a fruit tree, its a free harvest if you brought nets.

This natural behavior of using tools as weapons has allowed those who have these companions to teach them how to use more advanced crafted tools.  This is usually limited to thrown weapons as there is less to teach, but some have trained their devil monkey's to wield maces and other straight forward melee weapons.  While these monkey's are exceptional for an animal, they are still animals.

**Required**: Animal companion class feature

**Alignment:**  Any.

**Hit Dice:** d12
**Proficiency:** None
**Added Class skills:**  Handle Animal, Knowledge:Nature

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)** modifier.

**Monkey Wrangling (Ex):** A Monkey Wrangler may add devil monkey to the list of available animal companions. In addition, their levels in monkey wrangler stack with any that grant animal companions for the purposes of the animal's level.
If an animal companion class feature is selected as an ingrained class feature you may increase your class level in a different class feature instead.

**Advanced Training(Ex)**: At 3rd level, your animal companion may learn one proficiency that you have for every 10 hit dice it possesses. This may be any proficiency, such as a skill, a single weapon, or type of armor.  Your companion must still be capable of taking advantage of the proficiency to gain any benefit per gm discretion. 

**Shared Talent(ex) :** At 5th level, you may share one ingrained class feature with your animal companion. Your companion uses your class level, but otherwise uses its own statistics to determine the effects of the class feature, if they apply. Some features may have additional requirements an animal companion lacks, such as spell casting, or may have intelligence requirements and can not be shared.  Ultimately, the shared class feature is subject to GM approval.

A cohort may not benefit from this.

**Drake Master**

The Drake Masters of the continent, unlike many others that employ creatures, do not raise them and tame them through traditional methods.  The Drake Masters instead rely on ancient magical techniques that bind the drake to their owner.  The bindings become inherit to the drake and may not be broken or dispelled once formed without harming the drake. However, over the years, the drake masters have learned to improve the already mighty drakes using these rituals.

Drake Masters are not native to the Splintfall Mountain region, but can be found everywhere in the continent.

**Required:** Animal companion class feature

**Drake Mastery(Ex):** A Drake Master must select drake as an animal companion and follow the existing drake rules for their progression (except for BAB and HD). Drake master levels stack with any existing class that provides the animal companion class feature for the purposes of the animal's level.  
If an animal companion class feature is selected as an ingrained class you may increase your class level in a different feature.

**Mounted Combatant(Ex)**: At 3rd level, you gain the Mounted Combat bonus feat.  In addition, you gain a +10 bonus to your ride check to avoid an attack targeting your mount while flying.

**Magical Infusion(ex) :** At 5th level, your drake gains one point of eidelon evolution for every 5HD it possesses.


**Patron Knight**

The patron knights of the City of Peace are both diplomats and soldiers.   They report directly to the four Great Houses of the ruling council of the city, and are often sent to neighboring kingdoms to offer assistance. 
In this way, they form the front line of their city's defenses: maintaining valuable alliances and successfully deterring hostile intentions before they manifest into something greater.  

Their helpful nature is well known, but many believe the patron knights also serve as spies for the city and are careful about what they say around them. While they certainly report anything they learn to their superiors, espionage is far from their goal.

**Requirements:**

You must be a native of the City of Peace and invited to join this organization.  Only the good aligned should consider themselves candidates.

**Alignment:**  Any Good.

**Hit Dice:** d8
**Proficiency:** Heavy Armor, All Shields
**Added Class skills:**   Diplomacy, Sense Motive,  Knowledge (History), Heal, Linguistics, Survival

|5th|5|+4|+1|+4|Ritual of Protection|

**House Insignia (Ex):**  Every Patron Knight is sworn to one of the four great houses in the City of Peace.  This oath comes along with a wrist tattoo.  This tattoo serves as a badge of office in addition to its other uses.

`	`**House Leafbinder** : Ushuk Leafbinder, The Goddess of Peace, was the founder of this house.  Like their founder, the house is primarily an orcish house, and they are intensely devoted to living peacefully.  Unlike the other houses, if the Goddess of Peace abandons you, this house will also, without question.

`	`**House Proudfoot :** The Patron Knights of House Proudfoot are expected to be among the most exuberant and outgoing.  It is not enough to help those in need, enjoying the act is just as important.  They do believe in peace, and dutifully work to maintain it.

`	`**House Drux** :  House Drux was founded by the Dwarvish slaves that escaped with Ushuk when the city was founded.  They are a difficult house to predict, as they are willing to embrace peace, but they see their enemies for what they are and do not shy from conflict. They rarely share any empathy for their enemies the same way as House Leafbinder does.

`	`**House Fourth :** The fourth house was founded by clockwork humanoids.  The creatures of this house suffered the most while in slavery, but sadly it did not cause them to develop a sense of humor or greater imagination.  They are the most pragmatic of the Great houses, and they only embrace the idea of peace because it has worked so far.  

As you gain levels in Patron Knight, you gain the following spell like abilities and may use each once per day.  Your caster level is your hit dice and the casting stat for these spells is Charisma.


|Level|1|2|3|4|5|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|House Leafbinder|Know Direction|Shield|Shield Other|Magic Vestment|Globe of invulnerability|
|House Proudfoot|Ghost Sound|Charm Person|Speak with Plants|Good Hope|Tongues|
|House Drux|Light|Protection from Evil|Soften Earth and Stone|Remove Disease|Secure Shelter|
|House Fourth|Detect Magic|Erase|Protection from Energy|See Invisibility|Detect Scrying|


**Oath of Peace:**  While a Patron Knight is sworn to a house, their true loyalty belongs to the goddess of peace.  When joining the order, in a private and secret ceremony, a Patron Knight binds themselves to the commitment of non-violent solutions to all problems.

**Divine Purpose:**  Your faith in a city forever free of war has been noticed, and rewarded.  For defending her city, the goddess of peace has blessed you with a gift.  

Anytime you are attempting to solve a dangerous situation with non-violence and you need to roll as a result, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

**Ritual of Protection :** At 5th level, once per day, you may perform a 15 minute ritual of protection.  Once complete, the ritual will last for 24 hours, or until you take a hostile action.  For the duration, anyone you meet will treat you as one step more friendly than normal, in addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to diplomacy, bluff, sense motive, all saves, and AC.


**Ex Patron Knights:**  The Goddess of Peace watches her followers closely.  Those who stray from the path of peace but stay in their House's favor retain their House Insignia, but loose all other powers.

**Excommunicated from a Great House:**  It is possible a great house may ask something of you that the goddess herself may object to.  If for some extreme circumstance causes this to happen, and you stay true to the goddess, you will loose your house Insignia, but retain all other class features.

**Deepfyord Guardsman**

Housed outside the town of Deepfyord, The School for the Gentlemanly Enforcement of Order trains a significant amount of the north coast's elite guards.  The graduates tend to serve as castle guards or personal escorts, as the general patrolmen are not worth the training investment.

**Requirement:**

500 Gold Tuition

**Proficiency:** All weapons with the Non Lethal property.

**Tools of the Trade:**  Few guardsman are lucky enough to face any true threat in their day to day lives, and are therefor forced to become proficient in the use of less than lethal weapons.

`	`Thanks for diligent practice and improved technique, when wielding a weapon with the non lethal property, you may treat it as one size larger for the purposes of damage.

**Takedown:** As a standard action, you may make a special grab attack with a melee weapon you are holding.

**Improvised restraints:**  When you start a turn grappling a creature, you may spend a full round action to securely tie them up.   There must be rope or suitable tying material within reach or on your person to preform this action.   Once accomplished, your target is considered helpless and immobilized, but may still preform purely mental actions.

**Shield Wall:**  While using a tower shield, you may add your shield bonus to your fortitude saves.

**Westvalley Button Man**


Perhaps nowhere on the continent is the art of murder more openly practiced than in the sparring halls of the Westvalley School for Murder.  Originally an assassins guild, influence from some prominent locals encouraged the school to seek out a more reputable way of building a fortune.

Admission to the school is quite prestigious, as many noble and powerful houses view having a Westvalley graduate among their number as an essential requirement in polite society.

**Requirement:** 10,000 gold admissions fee.  Paid in advance, in full. Preferably in large gems and platinum.   No regional currencies accepted.

**Alignment:**  Any.

**Sneak Attack**:  While using a light weapon, when attacking a flatfooted opponent, or an enemy flanked by an ally, you may add 1d6 precision damage to your damage roll.

**Concealed Combat:**  You gain proficiency with the War Razor and sword cane. When attacking an opponent with a weapon that was concealed to them at the start of your turn, they are considered flat footed.  You treat the sword cane as a light weapon.

**Wet Neck:**  When making an attack roll, if the result of the roll is a natural 20, all sneak attack dice are treated as being rolled at their maximum value.  This increase occurs even if the threatened critical is not confirmed.




**Eveffian Pugilist**

The dwarves of Evef have a long reputation to the aversion of tools and metal objects in general, and an even longer one for having the strongest fists on the continent.   Most speculate both arose out the saltstone ore they mine locally. The strange toxic ore must be mined by hand and fist, as it is known to rapidly corrode and decay both metal and wooden tools.

There are no schools in Evef to learn to fight like the locals.  One simply has to join the miners in the mine, and you will learn soon enough.

**Requirements:**

The mine does not hire someone if they think they will be useless or die before the end of the first day.

Min Strength: 18

Min Constitution: 15

**Tough Fingers:**   While the mines toughen your hands during the day, the bars at night teach you to use them.  You gain the improved unarmed combat feat.  

**Barroom Fighting**:  While using a light weapon, when attacking a flatfooted opponent, or an enemy flanked by an ally, you may add 1d6 damage to your damage roll.  This is precision damage.

**Iron Lungs:**  The dangers of mining have taught you how to get to a safe place, before passing out.  Anytime you have to save vs an effect on your lungs, such as cloud kill or suffocate, whether you succeed or not on the saving throw, all effects on you are delayed by one turn.

**Piercing Strikes:** Any time you attack unarmed or with a weapon from the close group, you may add your dexterity modifier to the damage roll, in addition to your strength.

**Mine Sight:**  You have lived in the darkness for more hours than you'd care to remember.  Anytime you are without the use of your sight, you gain blind sense 15ft.


**Darktown Firebrigadier**

While every town has a volunteer fire brigade, the administrators of Darktown thought it unnecessary to have separate groups managing the post, performing guard duty, repairing the infrastructure, and putting out the fires.  Certainly one person can accomplish those simple tasks.   In addition, the administrators also agreed it was unnecessary for separate equipment to be needed.   Thus were born the ladder wielding civil servants of Darktown known as a fire brigadier.

At the time of their creation, the town had a population of 600 and the firebrigadiers were not specialized.  The town is now 23,000+ residents large, and the organization is large enough to be slightly more specializated than before, although they do all still carry ladders.

**Requirements:**

Rather than create a code of ethics or lengthy set of rules for their civil servants, the administrators simply employed clerics to hire good people and trust they will get things right.

**Alignment:**  Any Good

**Battle Ladder:**  When wielding a battle ladder you are treated as having the two weapon fighting feat.

**Trapping Strike:**  When attacking an enemy from a higher altitude, you may choose to attempt to cause the ladder to trap your foe rather than strike them.  When your attack hits, you may chose to not deal damage and instead attempt a grapple combat maneuver.  The DC to break this grapple is equal to your CMD if you are holding the ladder.  If you release the ladder, the opponent is still restrained, but can free themselves with a standard action on their turn.

**Jab:**  You have learned to strike from a greater distance by not swinging your ladder weapon.  When making an attack with a ladder, you may choose to Jab rather than make a normal attack,  if you do so, your reach increases by 5ft, but you may not combine this with a trip maneuver or a trapping strike.

In addition, you are treated as having the improved two weapon fighting feat when wielding a battle ladder.

**Acrobatic Climb**:  As a swift action, you may set your ladder vertically and climb to the top.  While balancing on your ladder, you may act as though you were in the square above yours and may choose to treat your hands as empty.   If you end your turn balancing on top of your ladder, make an acrobatics check, DC 20, to stay there.  Failure results in falling to the floor prone.

You may make an attack with your ladder while standing on it, but doing causes you to land on the ground holding your ladder after the attack is made.

**Extender:**  As a senior member of the defense force, you have been granted an engineering marvel, an extending ladder.   As a move action, your 4 foot ladder can be extended into an 7.5 foot ladder.

`	`While using it as a 4 foot ladder, it is much heavier than your prior ladder, and therefor uses a damage dice one size higher than normal.

`	`While using the extended version, the weapon's base reach becomes 10ft, and acrobatic climb allows you to act as though you were up to 10 feet above you.  It is also possible to preform a trapping strike with reach, likely preventing your opponent from being in reach to attack back.

In addition, you are treated as having the greater two weapon fighting feat while using a battle ladder.

**Masonry:**  As your years of service in the guard have added up, so has your experience repairing and maintaining the town walls.  So much so that you have become adept at spotting weakness in stone walls, natural or otherwise.

`	`While making a full attack next to a natural or artificial stone wall, you may choose to help break loose a few stones with each strike.  Doing so incurs a -2 penalty to the attack roll, but causes an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage on hit.


# **Brontotherium Rangler**

The planes to the south of the Great Living Forests are known for their mega-fauna.  There are many great species worth hunting, but the tribal hunters of the region have long preferred to track and hunt the great brontotherium, locally known as brontos.

The skin of the local brontos is exceptionally thick, and as a result the preferred method of hunting is using lassos and nets to drive the animals into a prepared pit trap.

**Requirement:**

BAB: 5

Has a friendly relationship with a tribe in the planes, most likely through a favor or being a member.

**Alignment:**  Any

**Hit Dice:** d10

**Pit Trap(Ex):** You may cast Create Pit as an extraordinary ability a number of times per day equal to half your Brontotherium Rangler.  Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level and the save is based on your wisdom.

**Neck Bound:** When using a lasso to entangle a foe, you have mastered the ability to throw it around their neck, strangling them when tightened.  An opponent entangled cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.

**Improved Pit Trap(Ex):** When you use your Pit Trap ability, you may choose to cast Spiked Pit.

In addition, you may now use your Pit Trap as a move action

**Rope Tricks:** You have learned to wield nets and ropes made of sturdier and more powerful materials.  

`	`Your Lasso's now have an Escape Artist DC equal to 10 + Rangler level + Intelligence Modifier, and has a strength DC of 15 + Rangler Level.

`	`Your Net's now have an Escape Artist DC equal to 15 + Rangler level + Intelligence Modifier, and has a strength DC of 20 + Rangler Level.

**Master Pit Trap(Ex):** When you use your Pit Trap ability, you may apply a single property to your extra-dimensional pit.  If you do, you may select one of the following: Heavy Gravity, impeded magic, water-dominant, erratic time

Your Pit Trap may now be performed as a swift action.

**Improved Drag:** You gain the improved drag feat as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites.  In addition, you may perform this maneuver against foes you have entangled with a rope or net.

If you drag an opponent over a pit trap, or any hazard that would normally allow a save to not fall into, you may release the grab in order to drop them into the trap.  They do not receive a save from the effect.



**Sigbathian Acrobat**

The Sigbathian Circus was a traveling circus that roamed the eastern coast of the continent.  When the Scar formed, they found themselves trapped in the elven lands.  Not able to return north, the circus made a permanent home outside Silversun and remain there today.


Their acrobat act has developed into their star attraction, as their artists don't just swing and flip, but have incorporated martial displays as part of their acts.  With slow fall enchantments, there is little actual danger, but the displays are impressive none the less.

The acrobats are always looking for new recruits.  All of the weapon displays were techniques brought into the school by outsiders, and the Sigbathian's are always happy to trade fighting style secrets.

**Requirements:**

Must have one ingrained class feature that improves melee or ranged attacks.

**Alignment:**  Any

**Hit Dice:** d8
**Proficiency:** none
**Added Class skills:** Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb

**Quick Step Up:**  You may stand up from prone as a free action.

**Slow Fall:**  You ignore the first 40 feet of falling damage.

**Evasion:**  You gain evasion.  If you already have evasion, you gain improved evasion.

**Defensive Roll:** An acrobat can avoid a potentially lethal blow.  Once per day, when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points from damage, an acrobat can attempt to roll with the blow with a reflex save.  The DC of the save is the amount of damage greater than the amount that would bring you to 0 hit points.  If the save succeeds, then you negate the damage that brings you below 0 hit points.

**Cartwheels:**  As a special full round action, you may incorporate acrobatics with your attacks.  You may either make a charge attack, or a skirmish attack.   Roll an acrobatics skill check at a DC of 20

`	`If you made a charge attack, you charge as normal.  If you succeeded on your acrobatics roll, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you deal any sneak attack damage you have at the end of your charge.

**Darktown Assassin**

The town of Darktown is officially run by a group of elected administrators, but the day to day reality is largely defined by several large organizations. Two of the largest, The Traders Guild and the Mages Guild, both have large membership, but they are both mainly controlled by 3 wealthy families.

The heads of these families joined together centuries ago to form a secret society with the ultimate goal of taking control of the town.  In pursuit of this goal, they created several organizations of assassins.  Over the centuries, these assassins guilds have been taken down by the local authorities, but a new one will inevitably rise and replace it.   In many ways, the families have succeeded, but their ascent was full of betrayals and assassinations.

If one knows where to look, and they can contact one of these assassin groups.  Taking a contract is always optional, and the training is free.

**Hammer-thrower of Mount Herbert**

Mount Herbert rests along Lake Everlane, overlooking the city and suburbs of Godzer.  The dwarves that live in the Southern Splintfall Mountains kept to themselves for many centuries.  Preferring to do business with the network of dwarven fortresses stretching across the continent.

Most of this reclusive existence owes itself to the great naga civilizations that surrounded these mountains for mainy years. While nearly as stubborn, the naga knew the dwarves made better slaves than the elves, and forced the dwarves to stay in their great halls and mountain pathways.

After the fall of the naga empires, Mount Herbert began to open its doors, allowing caravans inside for the first time in the history of their town.  After the Scar formed in the world and cut the dwarves off from the rest of dwarven civilization, they no longer had a choice. As their only talents lay in forging, they began sending out trading caravans and emissaries to find nearby allies and new sources of goods.

Today, the dwarves have found trading partners across Flintfall's Splinter.  Their main trading partner is East Berrydew, where they supply a steady stream of weapons and armor, in exchange for food.  The dwarves of Mount Herbert take their crafting skills seriously, and most children learn to swing a hammer and work the bellows before they can speak.

# **Student of the Order of Evergreen Mountain**

Last Watch holds a great and dark secret.  600 years ago, the city mistakenly made a pact with a powerful entity that was later to be revealed as an archdevil.   The city's coven's leader, betrayed the city, and created a permanent portal within a small local monastery on the side of Evergreen Mountain.  The devils that spewed forth were destroyed, but the portal could not be unmade without finding its creator who fled into the Scar, or destroying the Archdevil.  The order of monks, at first with help from the witches, took the responsibility of guarding this portal from anything that comes from it, while the witches took the responsibility of closing it for good.

The city of Last Watch now entirely encompasses the monastery, but they have kept their original name.  Unlike most monasteries, the monks of Evergreen spend their days perfecting the art of teaching their techniques they have developed over the centuries for killing devils and welcome students in exchange for service.

The monastery, as its existence is secret, does not directly interact with potential students.  They only accept recommendations from the local coven to be tested for admission.

**East Berrydew Coven**

**Favored of Benjamin, god of Conquest**

The faithful that serve conquest are driven to find ways to bring ends to conflicts, rather than let them simmer quietly until they inevitably boil over.  The modern followers of this god are sworn to an oath to never harm an innocent in these conquests.

History tells a different story.  When the first god burst into a yellow and green light and dissipated into sky, his followers and generals were empowered as faithful, but were far from the clerics the world has come to know today.   Cruel and ruthless, they used their new found power to expand the city-state of Bentown and in hopes it would bring greater worship to their new god king, and therefor greater power for themselves.

Caught in the wake of this expansion, was a large monastery that refused to worship.  After their head monk was killed as a 'warning', the entire order of monks disappeared into the nearby forests overnight. They were not heard from again, until 1200 years later, when a small army of 200 appeared outside the walls of the capital of Bentown.

Historians do not have a clear record of what happened that night, apart from the following:  Every follower of Benjamin was killed, those who didn't believe in him were spared, and his followers never again would harm anyone innocent.

While the modern followers of this god stress lawful behavior, there is some theological debate as to if the god's nature is now lawful, a bargain was made, or if this was simply a survival tactic.

**Favored of Edgar, God of Hard Work**

Edgar came from very little.  His family farmed a field for a wealthy elvish nobleman near Sandytomb.  Seeing that this work wasn't going to lead to anything except more of the same, he began to work on ways to make money outside of his job.  He also began to develop a growing hatred for the noble class, who he saw as contributing nothing.  These efforts resulted in little pay, but his dissatisfaction and desire to improve himself garnered the attention of a local recruit for the Faithless.

The years he spent with the Faithless proved invaluable, and through the organizations connections, and the skills he acquired, he was able to rise to the position of Chief Administrator for Sandytomb and ruler of the leading council.  Once he had the power to begin enacting his plans, he was swift.  He viewed Nobles as lazy and an ultimately unnecessary benefactor of craftsmen and farmers actual work, and issued a radical decree.  “All land was to be immediately deeded to the current workers and occupants.”  Not only did he publicly declare this, but he organized new deeds of ownership for farms and private housing ahead of time, and had it delivered the same day.

The result was massive outrage and Edgar was expelled from office, but the damage was done.  The deeds were technically lawful, and while the next administrator could have changed it, they instead decided to not cause a peasant uprising and instead recover some of their lost earnings via taxation.  In an attempt to harm his reputation, the day those taxes are due is known as Edgar day.  Unfortunately for the nobles, this became a day of celebration.

Edgar went back to the farm he was raised on, which was now owned and worked by his brothers and sisters.  He spent most of his days anonymous, going by the name “Fred”.  At the time of his death and ascension, his children and grandchildren were entirely unaware their favorite holiday had been in celebration of him.

**Sworn Oath:** You have sworn to continue the work Edgar did in life.  Attempt to find those profiting from someone's labor, and ensure the money is evenly distributed.

In addition, when wielding a pitchfork, your deity bestows their protection over you.  You may add your charisma modifier to all saves, if you do not already.

**Favored of Fingo, god of souls and the afterlives**

Fingo was born with a rare curse, as he was told.  The curse allowed him to see the souls lost wandering the continent.  But, Fingo was an exceptionally sociable individual, even for halflings, and saw no reason not to use this as a chance to make friends.   As he grew older, his spirit friends easily outnumbered his living friends, and he became increasingly interested in finding a solution to the endless wandering these souls are forced to endure.

Upon being urged by a series of souls, he applied to continue his work at the famed Timeless Academy of Magical Arts.  His application was rebuffed, but upon being able to prove his recommendations from 11 prior headmasters, he was invited to continue his research if he agreed to be studied and ask the occasional opinion from the spirits.

He spent 6 decades researching and traveling to meet new souls from across the continent.  He ultimately accomplished nothing of modern scholarly value, but the souls that believed in him proved otherwise.  When Fingo ascended to the Upper Panthion, his ascendance wasn't cheered by his followers.  The hundreds of thousands of lost souls who believed in him, and the several million he never had a chance to meet, moved on and found their own peace.

Most of the modern knowledge of the nature of a soul still on the continent is known from his work, although, now that souls move on, it is entirely irreverent.  While he isn't the first academic to prove his own work irreverent, he may be the first one to have done it by succeeding.

**Favored of Gohlynna, Goddess of the Harvest**

Gohlynna drew worship in a rather unfortunate way.  She lived in a society of druids, who stressed an extreme reverence to nature.  If a wild beast kills one of them, it was simply that druid's time.  But Gohlynna rejected this answer when her parents did not return from a hunt, and organized a group to hunt down the animals that would dare attack a druid.  They found the great beasts in their lair asleep and killed them quickly.

When they returned victorious, the city elders, who forbid them to take action, attempted to banish the party from the village.  But when it was revealed that these creatures had belongings from dozens of other missing villagers in their lair, the elder's lost the support of the people.

Gohlynna was made her tribes leader, and proceeded to cull the dangerous animals of the forest, and use the druids magic to aid their societies transition to an agricultural society.

Gohlynna would perhaps not ascended as a god, if she had lived a normal orc's lifespan.  However, her druidic talents served her well in extending her life and she was able to see her small tribal village expand into a massive city over the course of her 2300 year life.

Ruling the City of Gohlynnia is the head of their druidic order, and Gohlynna's great granddaughter.

**Favored of Thomtom, God of Music**

Like many of the Faithless who have ascended, Thomtom's true nature was a surprise to all his followers.  They knew him as a shrewd leader, a practiced diplomat, and spiritual guide.  He perhaps enjoyed a little music, but for that to be what he loved and fought for most in his life was a surprise to say the least.

Unfortunately for the historians of the world, much of Thomtom's life is no longer public knowledge.  Partly due to his followers largely abandoning him after his nature became apparent, and partly due to the Faithless ensuring bitter follower's stories did not travel far or last in their memory for long.

The bards and lovers of music who worship him today care little for why a fellow music lover has a share of the heavens.

**Faithful of Ushuk, Goddess of Peace**

Ushuk is the most famous of gods and arguably the most powerful in life.  In life, she is remembered for bringing down the great and terrible Naga civilization, which spanned nearly half the continent. Then, instead of conquering any land she wanted with her army of freed slaves, she altered the nature of a large enough portion of the Scar to settle a city.

Ushuk's followers, however, believe that how she did these things, and why she did them that way, is far more important for the world to learn.

Ushuk was born in a Naga breading pit, two years after the scar shook the world.  She had been bread to be a library orc, and proved herself useful enough assisting the wizards with their research to have life extending spells cast upon her.  While she learned a great deal of magic as part of her work, she was forbidden to learn offensive spells.  This did not deter her, as violence was not something she enjoyed or felt was ever needed among intelligent individuals.

Over 800 years passed, and Ushuk continued her work in the libraries.  At this point, she was spending her free time, not learning about defensive magic, but inventing it.  In doing so, she discovered an inherent weakness in the Naga.  Their magical nature was not from a kind and or neutral source of magic, but was malevolent in nature.  Utilizing spell work both counter to their own specialties in magic, and their fundamental nature itself, Ushuk developed a novel and unparalleled protective spell.

The ritual she developed would take over 24 hours of casting, but she was very skilled in pausing a ritual, and worked on the spell for a few hours a day as to not draw any suspicion.  When it was completed, the slave quarters were encased in a massive magical protective bubble.

The naga outside the barrier found they could not enter, and the ones inside felt an overwhelming desire to flee.  Ushuk had successfully created a protective sphere that prevents anyone who holds hate for its creators from venturing inside or casting spells targeting those inside.

The newly freed slaves assisted Ushuk in repeating the ritual, expanding the zone to eventually cover nearly the entire capitol.   As the naga relied entirely on slave labor to run their society, it came to a crashing halt.  

Ushuk then repeated the ritual in every naga city she was able to find.  Over the course of 10 years, Ushuk brought the largest civilization ever known to a crashing halt.  Today, the naga only exist in small settlements in underwater caverns and do not dare attempt to occupy the land once again.

**Divine Protection:**  At 10th level, you have finally earned the trust required to perform your goddesses most famous ritual.  As a 24 hour ritual, you may cast a protective spell over an area equal to 25 feet per caster level.  Once completed, this spell lasts until the caster is killed.  

When this spell is complete, it blocks both line of sight and line of effect for any spell.  In addition, any creature with hatred in their heart for you can not pass through the barrier without succeeding at an opposed caster level check.  Any enemy inside must make the same check or be driven mad with fear until they flee the protective zone.

Your caster level for this ability is considered your total character level plus your Faithful of Ushuk levels.
