**Patron Knight**

The patron knights of the City of Peace are both diplomats and soldiers.   They report directly to the four Great Houses of the ruling council of the city, and are often sent to neighboring kingdoms to offer assistance. 
In this way, they form the front line of their city's defenses: maintaining valuable alliances and successfully deterring hostile intentions before they manifest into something greater.  

Their helpful nature is well known, but many believe the patron knights also serve as spies for the city and are careful about what they say around them. While they certainly report anything they learn to their superiors, espionage is far from their goal.

**Requirements:**

You must be a native of the City of Peace and invited to join this organization.  Only the good aligned should consider themselves candidates.

**Alignment:**  Any Good.

**House Insignia (Ex):**  Every Patron Knight is sworn to one of the four great houses in the City of Peace.  This oath comes along with a wrist tattoo.  This tattoo serves as a badge of office in addition to its other uses.

`	`**House Leafbinder** : Ushuk Leafbinder, The Goddess of Peace, was the founder of this house.  Like their founder, the house is primarily an orcish house, and they are intensely devoted to living peacefully.  Unlike the other houses, if the Goddess of Peace abandons you, this house will also, without question.

`	`**House Proudfoot :** The Patron Knights of House Proudfoot are expected to be among the most exuberant and outgoing.  It is not enough to help those in need, enjoying the act is just as important.  They do believe in peace, and dutifully work to maintain it.

`	`**House Drux** :  House Drux was founded by the Dwarvish slaves that escaped with Ushuk when the city was founded.  They are a difficult house to predict, as they are willing to embrace peace, but they see their enemies for what they are and do not shy from conflict. They rarely share any empathy for their enemies the same way as House Leafbinder does.

`	`**House Fourth :** The fourth house was founded by clockwork humanoids.  The creatures of this house suffered the most while in slavery, but sadly it did not cause them to develop a sense of humor or greater imagination.  They are the most pragmatic of the Great houses, and they only embrace the idea of peace because it has worked so far.  

As you gain levels in Patron Knight, you gain the following spell like abilities and may use each once per day.  Your caster level is your hit dice and the casting stat for these spells is Charisma.


|Level|1|2|3|4|5|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |

|House Drux|Light|Protection from Evil|Soften Earth and Stone|Remove Disease|Secure Shelter|
|House Fourth|Detect Magic|Erase|Protection from Energy|See Invisibility|Detect Scrying|


**Oath of Peace:**  While a Patron Knight is sworn to a house, their true loyalty belongs to the goddess of peace.  When joining the order, in a private and secret ceremony, a Patron Knight binds themselves to the commitment of non-violent solutions to all problems.

**Divine Purpose:**  Your faith in a city forever free of war has been noticed, and rewarded.  For defending her city, the goddess of peace has blessed you with a gift.  

Anytime you are attempting to solve a dangerous situation with non-violence and you need to roll as a result, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

**Ritual of Protection :** At 5th level, once per day, you may perform a 15 minute ritual of protection.  Once complete, the ritual will last for 24 hours, or until you take a hostile action.  For the duration, anyone you meet will treat you as one step more friendly than normal, in addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to diplomacy, bluff, sense motive, all saves, and AC.


**Ex Patron Knights:**  The Goddess of Peace watches her followers closely.  Those who stray from the path of peace but stay in their House's favor retain their House Insignia, but loose all other powers.

**Excommunicated from a Great House:**  It is possible a great house may ask something of you that the goddess herself may object to.  If for some extreme circumstance causes this to happen, and you stay true to the goddess, you will loose your house Insignia, but retain all other class features.


**Eveffian Pugilist**

The dwarves of Evef have a long reputation to the aversion of tools and metal objects in general, and an even longer one for having the strongest fists on the continent.   Most speculate both arose out the saltstone ore they mine locally. The strange toxic ore must be mined by hand and fist, as it is known to rapidly corrode and decay both metal and wooden tools.

There are no schools in Evef to learn to fight like the locals.  One simply has to join the miners in the mine, and you will learn soon enough.

**Requirements:**

The mine does not hire someone if they think they will be useless or die before the end of the first day.

**Barroom Fighting**:  While using a light weapon, when attacking a flatfooted opponent, or an enemy flanked by an ally, you may add 1d6 damage to your damage roll.  This is precision damage.

**Iron Lungs:**  The dangers of mining have taught you how to get to a safe place, before passing out.  Anytime you have to save vs an effect on your lungs, such as cloud kill or suffocate, whether you succeed or not on the saving throw, all effects on you are delayed by one turn.

**Piercing Strikes:** Any time you attack unarmed or with a weapon from the close group, you may add your dexterity modifier to the damage roll, in addition to your strength.

**Mine Sight:**  You have lived in the darkness for more hours than you'd care to remember.  Anytime you are without the use of your sight, you gain blind sense 15ft.



# **Brontotherium Rangler**

The planes to the south of the Great Living Forests are known for their mega-fauna.  There are many great species worth hunting, but the tribal hunters of the region have long preferred to track and hunt the great brontotherium, locally known as brontos.

If you drag an opponent over a pit trap, or any hazard that would normally allow a save to not fall into, you may release the grab in order to drop them into the trap.  They do not receive a save from the effect.



**Swordsman of the Great Plateau**


South of Pimdak, resides an ancient training site still being operated today.  Originally built by the naga, the orc's they trained here claimed it for themselves after the naga's collapse.  

This school continues to teach willing students who desire to defend the township of Pimdak their brutal techniques.  The orcs teach their students to learn to smash through their opponents defenses directly, rather than avoid them.

Graduates of the Great Plateau are terrifying in battle, as they often leave their enemies armor and weapons in as many pieces as their opponents.

**Requirements:**

Strength 20

The techniques of the defenders of the great plateau are not for sale and one must prove they are an ally to their township.

# **Student of the Order of Evergreen Mountain**

Last Watch holds a great and dark secret.  600 years ago, the city mistakenly made a pact with a powerful entity that was later to be revealed as an archdevil.   The city's coven's leader, betrayed the city, and created a permanent portal within a small local monastery on the side of Evergreen Mountain.  The devils that spewed forth were destroyed, but the portal could not be unmade without finding its creator who fled into the Scar, or destroying the Archdevil.  The order of monks, at first with help from the witches, took the responsibility of guarding this portal from anything that comes from it, while the witches took the responsibility of closing it for good.

The city of Last Watch now entirely encompasses the monastery, but they have kept their original name.  Unlike most monasteries, the monks of Evergreen spend their days perfecting the art of teaching their techniques they have developed over the centuries for killing devils and welcome students in exchange for service.

The monastery, as its existence is secret, does not directly interact with potential students.  They only accept recommendations from the local coven to be tested for admission.

**East Berrydew Coven**

The Southern Bay of Berrydew has a surprisingly friendly population of sea hags.  To outsiders, mainly due to their non offensive appearance, they are often not even recognized as sea hags.  Some suspect their appearance and behavior is a natural result from naga experimentation.  The more superstitious speak of a truce after an ancient and great battle, some even leave offerings for the hags as thanks for honoring the treaty.

Over time, the local coven became friendly with the hags, and were even able to covertly recruit some to join their coven.  The techniques they taught each other have shaped themselves as much as their abilities.

**West Mucklands Coven**

The coven of West Mucklands is small, and ordinary as far as covens go.  They tend to local matters and help keep their flock healthy.  What sets them apart is their innate talents for doing so.

West Muckland is not a wealthy town or religious area, but the witches have more then made up for their lack of clerics and alchemists.

**Favored of Benjamin, god of Conquest**

The faithful that serve conquest are driven to find ways to bring ends to conflicts, rather than let them simmer quietly until they inevitably boil over.  The modern followers of this god are sworn to an oath to never harm an innocent in these conquests.

History tells a different story.  When the first god burst into a yellow and green light and dissipated into sky, his followers and generals were empowered as faithful, but were far from the clerics the world has come to know today.   Cruel and ruthless, they used their new found power to expand the city-state of Bentown and in hopes it would bring greater worship to their new god king, and therefor greater power for themselves.

Caught in the wake of this expansion, was a large monastery that refused to worship.  After their head monk was killed as a 'warning', the entire order of monks disappeared into the nearby forests overnight. They were not heard from again, until 1200 years later, when a small army of 200 appeared outside the walls of the capital of Bentown.

Historians do not have a clear record of what happened that night, apart from the following:  Every follower of Benjamin was killed, those who didn't believe in him were spared, and his followers never again would harm anyone innocent.

While the modern followers of this god stress lawful behavior, there is some theological debate as to if the god's nature is now lawful, a bargain was made, or if this was simply a survival tactic.

**Requirement:**

Cleric of Benjamin, god of Conquest.

Must have never broken his unbreakable tenet

or

Must never have broken the god of Conquest, Benjamin's Minor or Unbreakable Tenets.

You have made an oath to finish the work Benjamin did in life: seek out those who disrupt and harm civilization, and bring them to justice.

**Communal Bond:**  At 10th level, once per day, when you use an ability or cast a spell that normally only targets yourself, you may have it also apply to an adjacent ally.

**Favored of Edgar, God of Hard Work**

Edgar came from very little.  His family farmed a field for a wealthy elvish nobleman near Sandytomb.  Seeing that this work wasn't going to lead to anything except more of the same, he began to work on ways to make money outside of his job.  He also began to develop a growing hatred for the noble class, who he saw as contributing nothing.  These efforts resulted in little pay, but his dissatisfaction and desire to improve himself garnered the attention of a local recruit for the Faithless.

The years he spent with the Faithless proved invaluable, and through the organizations connections, and the skills he acquired, he was able to rise to the position of Chief Administrator for Sandytomb and ruler of the leading council.  Once he had the power to begin enacting his plans, he was swift.  He viewed Nobles as lazy and an ultimately unnecessary benefactor of craftsmen and farmers actual work, and issued a radical decree.  “All land was to be immediately deeded to the current workers and occupants.”  Not only did he publicly declare this, but he organized new deeds of ownership for farms and private housing ahead of time, and had it delivered the same day.

The result was massive outrage and Edgar was expelled from office, but the damage was done.  The deeds were technically lawful, and while the next administrator could have changed it, they instead decided to not cause a peasant uprising and instead recover some of their lost earnings via taxation.  In an attempt to harm his reputation, the day those taxes are due is known as Edgar day.  Unfortunately for the nobles, this became a day of celebration.

Edgar went back to the farm he was raised on, which was now owned and worked by his brothers and sisters.  He spent most of his days anonymous, going by the name “Fred”.  At the time of his death and ascension, his children and grandchildren were entirely unaware their favorite holiday had been in celebration of him.

**Favored of Fingo, god of souls and the afterlives**

Fingo was born with a rare curse, as he was told.  The curse allowed him to see the souls lost wandering the continent.  But, Fingo was an exceptionally sociable individual, even for halflings, and saw no reason not to use this as a chance to make friends.   As he grew older, his spirit friends easily outnumbered his living friends, and he became increasingly interested in finding a solution to the endless wandering these souls are forced to endure.

Upon being urged by a series of souls, he applied to continue his work at the famed Timeless Academy of Magical Arts.  His application was rebuffed, but upon being able to prove his recommendations from 11 prior headmasters, he was invited to continue his research if he agreed to be studied and ask the occasional opinion from the spirits.

He spent 6 decades researching and traveling to meet new souls from across the continent.  He ultimately accomplished nothing of modern scholarly value, but the souls that believed in him proved otherwise.  When Fingo ascended to the Upper Panthion, his ascendance wasn't cheered by his followers.  The hundreds of thousands of lost souls who believed in him, and the several million he never had a chance to meet, moved on and found their own peace.

Most of the modern knowledge of the nature of a soul still on the continent is known from his work, although, now that souls move on, it is entirely irreverent.  While he isn't the first academic to prove his own work irreverent, he may be the first one to have done it by succeeding.

**Favored of Gohlynna, Goddess of the Harvest**

Gohlynna drew worship in a rather unfortunate way.  She lived in a society of druids, who stressed an extreme reverence to nature.  If a wild beast kills one of them, it was simply that druid's time.  But Gohlynna rejected this answer when her parents did not return from a hunt, and organized a group to hunt down the animals that would dare attack a druid.  They found the great beasts in their lair asleep and killed them quickly.

When they returned victorious, the city elders, who forbid them to take action, attempted to banish the party from the village.  But when it was revealed that these creatures had belongings from dozens of other missing villagers in their lair, the elder's lost the support of the people.

Gohlynna was made her tribes leader, and proceeded to cull the dangerous animals of the forest, and use the druids magic to aid their societies transition to an agricultural society.

Gohlynna would perhaps not ascended as a god, if she had lived a normal orc's lifespan.  However, her druidic talents served her well in extending her life and she was able to see her small tribal village expand into a massive city over the course of her 2300 year life.

Ruling the City of Gohlynnia is the head of their druidic order, and Gohlynna's great granddaughter.

**Favored of Thomtom, God of Music**

Like many of the Faithless who have ascended, Thomtom's true nature was a surprise to all his followers.  They knew him as a shrewd leader, a practiced diplomat, and spiritual guide.  He perhaps enjoyed a little music, but for that to be what he loved and fought for most in his life was a surprise to say the least.

Unfortunately for the historians of the world, much of Thomtom's life is no longer public knowledge.  Partly due to his followers largely abandoning him after his nature became apparent, and partly due to the Faithless ensuring bitter follower's stories did not travel far or last in their memory for long.

The bards and lovers of music who worship him today care little for why a fellow music lover has a share of the heavens.

**Faithful of Ushuk, Goddess of Peace**

Ushuk is the most famous of gods and arguably the most powerful in life.  In life, she is remembered for bringing down the great and terrible Naga civilization, which spanned nearly half the continent. Then, instead of conquering any land she wanted with her army of freed slaves, she altered the nature of a large enough portion of the Scar to settle a city.

Ushuk's followers, however, believe that how she did these things, and why she did them that way, is far more important for the world to learn.

Ushuk was born in a Naga breading pit, two years after the scar shook the world.  She had been bread to be a library orc, and proved herself useful enough assisting the wizards with their research to have life extending spells cast upon her.  While she learned a great deal of magic as part of her work, she was forbidden to learn offensive spells.  This did not deter her, as violence was not something she enjoyed or felt was ever needed among intelligent individuals.

Over 800 years passed, and Ushuk continued her work in the libraries.  At this point, she was spending her free time, not learning about defensive magic, but inventing it.  In doing so, she discovered an inherent weakness in the Naga.  Their magical nature was not from a kind and or neutral source of magic, but was malevolent in nature.  Utilizing spell work both counter to their own specialties in magic, and their fundamental nature itself, Ushuk developed a novel and unparalleled protective spell.

The ritual she developed would take over 24 hours of casting, but she was very skilled in pausing a ritual, and worked on the spell for a few hours a day as to not draw any suspicion.  When it was completed, the slave quarters were encased in a massive magical protective bubble.

The naga outside the barrier found they could not enter, and the ones inside felt an overwhelming desire to flee.  Ushuk had successfully created a protective sphere that prevents anyone who holds hate for its creators from venturing inside or casting spells targeting those inside.

The newly freed slaves assisted Ushuk in repeating the ritual, expanding the zone to eventually cover nearly the entire capitol.   As the naga relied entirely on slave labor to run their society, it came to a crashing halt.  

Ushuk then repeated the ritual in every naga city she was able to find.  Over the course of 10 years, Ushuk brought the largest civilization ever known to a crashing halt.  Today, the naga only exist in small settlements in underwater caverns and do not dare attempt to occupy the land once again.

When this spell is complete, it blocks both line of sight and line of effect for any spell.  In addition, any creature with hatred in their heart for you can not pass through the barrier without succeeding at an opposed caster level check.  Any enemy inside must make the same check or be driven mad with fear until they flee the protective zone.

Your caster level for this ability is considered your total character level plus your Faithful of Ushuk levels.
