# Ranger

For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among their own people.

## CLass Features

**Favored Enemy (Ex):**
At 1st level , a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger [favored enemies](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#Ranger-Favored-Enemies-Table)** table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge), [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception), [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive), and [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival)** checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) **[**skill checks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks)** untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.

At 3th level and every two levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-). In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

**Expert Tracker (Ex)**: A ranger adds her ranger class level to survival checks.  

**Combat Style** (Ex): At 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a ranger must select one [combat style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/ranger-combat-styles/) to pursue.

The ranger’s expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, and every 4 levels thereafter. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.

The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

**Wild Empathy** (Ex): At 2nd level, a ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal.  This ability functions like diplomacy, but the ranger rolls 1d20+ranger level+ wisdom bonus to determine the check.
To use this ability, the ranger must be within 30 feet of the animal.  Generally, it takes at least one minute to influence an animal.

This can be used against magical beasts with intelligence score of 1 or 2, but at a -4 penalty.

**Endurance (Ex):** At 3rd level, the ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat.

**Favored Terrain (Ex):**  At 3rd level and the ranger may select a favored terrain. The ranger gains a +2 terrain bonus to initiative checks, knowledge(geography), perception, stealth, survival checks when he is in this terrain.  A ranger traveling through a favored terrain only leaves a trail if they choose to.
At 5th level and every 2 thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain.  In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain increases by +2.

**Hunter’s Bond (Ex):** At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with an [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions). A ranger who selects an [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) can choose from the following list: [badger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger), [bird](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird), [camel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel), [cat (small)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small), [dire rat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire), [dog](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog), [horse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse), [pony](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony), snake ([viper](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper) or [constrictor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor)), or [wolf](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf). If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger’s [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) shares his [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) and [favored terrain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-) bonuses. 

**Spells:**  Beginning at 4th level, the ranger begins to cast spells from the ranger spell list, with a primary casting ability of wisdom.

This damage is increased by +1d6 at level 9 and every 4 levels thereafter.<br/>

If you are unconcous for any reason, your companion will not defend your body but will instead act with any surviving allies as effectively as possible.  Your companion will listen to whoever in the party they have known the longest or bonded with the most.<br/>

***Magical Specialty (Ex):*** Each ranger has a slightly different relationship with the fey wilds they draw their spell's power from.  Beginning at 7th level, a ranger has developed their own magical tradition.<br/>

**Expanded Spellwork:** At 7th level, you gain an additional spell per day for each spell level you have.<br/>
**Expanded Knowledge:**  You have worked with enough druids to understand some of their magic.  You may cast druid scrolls, using your ranger spell casting level for any check for not having the spell on your list.  In addition, you may add your wisdom modifier to the UMD roll, in addition to their charisma modifier normally associated with the skill.<br/>
**Natural Mastery:** At 10th level, you have learned to pull magic from terrain you know best.  When casting spells in a favored terrain, you gain a bonus to your caster level equal to your favored terrain initiative bonus.<br/>

**Selfish Casting:** When casting a spell that targets only yourself or your companion, you may cast it as a swift action.<br/>
**Quickened Mastery:** At 12th level, you may choose to sacrifice your highest spell level.  If you do, any spell you cast is considered altered by the quickened metamagic.  In addition, when you quicken a spell, you may choose to cast it as either a swift or move action.<br/>
At 20th level, and every 8 levels thereafter, the ranger may choose to sacrifice their next highest spell level in order to cast their lowest, or next lowest, level spells as free actions instead of swift when quickened.  Spells targeting yourself now always may be cast as free actions.

* **Enhanced Combatant:**  You have mastered the ability to enhance yourself long before combat.<br/>
**Extended Spellwork:**  At 7th level your harmless spells are considered to have the extend meta-magic applied.  You do not need the feat in order for this to work.<br/>
**Personal Mastery:** At 12th level, when you cast a spell with a target of personal, if the full duration of the spell effects both you and your animal companion.  In addition, you double the duration of this spell, this increase is additive to the increase grated by extend spell.<br/>

**Quarry** (Ex): At 8th level, once per day, a ranger can, as a swift action, denote one target within his line of sight as their quarry.
A ranger can take 10 on any skill check related to tracking or moving against the quarry.  In addition, the ranger receives +2 bonus to attack rolls made against the quarry, and critical threats are automatically confirmed.
This lasts until the target dies, or the ranger selects a new quarry.  A ranger may only have one quarry at a time. 
If the quarry is the ranger's favored enemy,  all allies receive the ranger's favored enemy bonus against the quarry.<br/>
The ranger gains an additional use of this ability at level 14 and every 6 levels thereafter.  

**Loyal Companion:** At 9th level, your companion gains a bonus to will saves equal to half your ranger level.

**Master Hunter (Ex):** Beginning at 10th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at her full attack bonus.  If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a fortitude save or die.  The DC of this save is equal to 10+1/2 the rangers class level + the ranger's wisdom modifier.   <br/>
A ranger can instead choose to deal non-lethal damage equal to the target creatures current hit points instead of killing their target. 
A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy they possess.
In addition, a ranger may add their favored enemy bonus to their saving throws against spells and effects triggered by their favored enemy.
