# Ranger

For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among their own people.

## CLass Features

**Favored Enemy (Ex):**
At 1st level , a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger [favored enemies](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#Ranger-Favored-Enemies-Table)** table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge), [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception), [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive), and [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival)** checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) **[**skill checks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks)** untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.

At 3th level and every two levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-). In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

**Expert Tracker (Ex)**: A ranger adds her ranger class level to survival checks.  

**Combat Style** (Ex): At 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a ranger must select one [combat style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/ranger-combat-styles/) to pursue.

The ranger’s expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, and every 4 levels thereafter. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.

The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

**Wild Empathy** (Ex): At 2nd level, a ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal.  This ability functions like diplomacy, but the ranger rolls 1d20+ranger level+ wisdom bonus to determine the check.
To use this ability, the ranger must be within 30 feet of the animal.  Generally, it takes at least one minute to influence an animal.

This can be used against magical beasts with intelligence score of 1 or 2, but at a -4 penalty.

**Endurance (Ex):** At 3rd level, the ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat.

**Favored Terrain (Ex):**  At 3rd level and the ranger may select a favored terrain. The ranger gains a +2 terrain bonus to initiative checks, knowledge(geography), perception, stealth, survival checks when he is in this terrain.  A ranger traveling through a favored terrain only leaves a trail if they choose to.
At 5th level and every 2 thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain.  In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain increases by +2.

**Hunter’s Bond (Ex):** At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with an [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions). A ranger who selects an [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) can choose from the following list: [badger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger), [bird](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird), [camel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel), [cat (small)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small), [dire rat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire), [dog](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog), [horse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse), [pony](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony), snake ([viper](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper) or [constrictor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor)), or [wolf](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf). If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger’s [animal companion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions) shares his [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) and [favored terrain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-) bonuses. 

**Spells:**  Beginning at 4th level, the ranger begins to cast spells from the ranger spell list, with a primary casting ability of wisdom.

You gain +1d6 precision damage when your opponent is flanked or denied their dexterity modifier.

**Furious Mastery:**  At 9th level, when you are wielding a two handed weapon, and using power attack, you do not suffer power attacks penalty on the first melee attack roll each turn.  If you already have an ability that prevents a penalty on your first attack, this instead applies to your second power attack each turn.<br/>

Your companion will listen to whoever in the party they have known the longest or bonded with the most.<br/>

***Magical Specialty (Ex):*** Each ranger has a slightly different relationship with the fey wilds they draw their spell's power from.  Beginning at 7th level, a ranger has developed their own magical tradition.<br/>

In addition, you may add your wisdom modifier to the UMD roll, in addition to their charisma modifier normally associated with the skill.<br/>

**Selfish Casting:** When casting a spell that targets only yourself or your companion, you may cast it as a swift action.<br/>

At 20th level, and every 8 levels thereafter, the ranger may choose to sacrifice their next highest spell level in order to cast their lowest, or next lowest, level spells as free actions instead of swift when quickened.  Spells targeting yourself now always may be cast as free actions.

* **Enhanced Combatant:**  You have mastered the ability to enhance yourself long before combat.<br/>
**Extended Spellwork:**  At 7th level your harmless spells are considered to have the extend meta-magic applied.  You do not need the feat in order for this to work.<br/>

**Master Hunter (Ex):** Beginning at 10th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at her full attack bonus.  If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a fortitude save or die.  The DC of this save is equal to 10+1/2 the rangers class level + the ranger's wisdom modifier.   <br/>
A ranger can instead choose to deal non-lethal damage equal to the target creatures current hit points instead of killing their target. 
A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy they possess.
In addition, a ranger may add their favored enemy bonus to their saving throws against spells and effects triggered by their favored enemy.
