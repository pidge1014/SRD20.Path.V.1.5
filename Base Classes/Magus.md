# Magus

There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their time perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without equal. The magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a discipline in which both spell and steel are used to devastating effect. As he grows in power, the magus unlocks powerful forms of arcana that allow him to merge his talents further, and at the pinnacle of his art, the magus becomes a blur of steel and magic, a force that few foes would dare to stand against.

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A magus is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. A magus is also proficient with light armor. He can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

## Class Features

**Arcane Pool (Ex):** At 1st level, the magus gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his [**Intelligence**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the magus prepares his spells.

**Enhanced Weaponry (Ex):** At 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus). These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|Spells <br/>
At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: [*dancing*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/dancing), [*flaming*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming), [*flaming burst*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming-burst), [*frost*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost), [*icy burst*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/icy-burst), [*keen*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen), [*shock*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock), [*shocking burst*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shocking-burst), [*speed*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed), or [*vorpal*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vorpal).<br/>
At 10th level, any weapon property is allowed.<br/>
Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.<br/>
A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.<br/>
If enhanced weapon is ingrained, it lasts all day once activated, rather than 1 minute.

**Spell Combat (Ex)**:At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like [two-weapon fighting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat), but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components)), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a [full-round action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions), he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a [**casting time**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time) of 1 [**standard action**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) (any [**attack roll**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), up to his [**Intelligence**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) bonus, and add the same amount as a [**circumstance bonus**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) on his [**concentration**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.
At 8th level, and every 7 levels thereafter, a magus can cast an additional spell during a full attack, which occurs after , assuming they are able to make the corresponding additional melee weapon attack.

***Martial Specialization:***<br/>
* **Unarmed Master:** While most magus learn to master casting with one hand, the unarmed masters of the magus have learned to exploit this.<br/>
**Unarmed Spell Combat** (Su): At  2nd level an  unarmed master can use their spell combat ability when unarmed.  They do not need to have a free hand for ranged spell combat.<br/>
**Two Free Hands** (Su): At 10th level, when making an unarmed attack, an unarmed master can choose to forgo it in order to cast a spell of their choice. They may do this once per round and is in addition to the spells they cast using spell combat.<br/>
At 18th level, and every 8 levels thereafter, a magus can forgo an additional attack in order to cast a spell each round.

* **Eldritch Archer:** Preferring to stay away from the fray, the eldritch archers of the orders of magus have become masters of delivering spells while carrying a bow.<br/>
**Ranged Spell Combat** (Su): At  2nd level an eldritch archer can use their spell combat ability with a ranged weapon of their choice.  They do not need to have a free hand for ranged spell combat.<br/>
**Spell-imbued Ammunition**(Su): At 10th level, they gain the ability to attach one magus spell to an ammunition.  By spending one spell, they imbue a piece of ammunition with the spell spent.  There is no limitation on the spell placed in the ammunition, but once it is used it will only trigger if it hits its target.  If it misses, the spell dissipates harmlessly.  If the spell hits, then it triggers as if it was cast targeting, or centered on the target of the attack.  If the spell required an attack, it is considered to have already succeeded. Once a spell is used this way on ammunition, it lasts for 12 hours or until used.<br/>
At 18th level and every 8 levels thereafter, the duration the spell imbued ammunition lasts increases by 8 hours.

* **Spellsword**: You specialize in using spells to defend yourself, allowing you to survive in melee to deliver your attacks.<br/>
**Sword Specialization:** At 2nd level, you gain a bonus feat you qualify for that requires or benefits one handed weapons or having a free hand.  You may select an additional bonus feat that meets these requirements every 3 levels thereafter.<br/>
**Precasting**:  At 4th level, you gain the ability to precast a spell and hold it into your weapon, as if it had the spell storing weapon property.<br/>
**Defensive Aftermath:**  At 8th level, when wielding a weapon in one hand and nothing in the other, you may add a shield bonus to yourself equal to twice the level of the last spell you cast.  This bonus lasts a number of hours equal to the triggering spells level.  This bonus is always replaced when a spell is cast, even if the new bonus is lower.

* **Great Weapon Master:**<br/>
**2-handed Spell Combat** (Su): At 2nd level, a great weapon master can use their spell combat ability with a two handed weapon of their choice.<br/>
**Melee Spellstrike** (Su): At 6th level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee [**touch attack**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks) normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus)) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks.<br/>
This attack uses the weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the [*keen*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen) weapon property or similar effects).  The spell effect on a successful [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) uses the weapon's critical modifier.

**Magus Arcana:** Starting at 3rd level, a magus learns arcane secrets tailored to his specific way of blending martial prowess and magical skill. Starting at 3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional [magus arcana](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana) for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a [magus arcana’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana) description, a magus cannot select a particular [magus arcana](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana) more than once. [Magus arcana](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana) that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted.<br/>
- A complete list of magus arcana can be found here: [Magus Arcana](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana)

**Spell Recall (Ex):** At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a [**swift action**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.<br/>
Every 4 levels thereafter, the number of arcane points required is reduced by 1. 

**Medium Armor:**  At 5th level, a magus gains proficiency with medium armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance . 

**Counterstrike(Ex):** At 6th level, whenever an enemy within reach of the magus successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from the magus after the spell is complete.  The magus does not need to have this target engaged. This [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) cannot disrupt the spell. 

**Knowledge Pool:** At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)** bonus. For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells. He can also cast spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he prepares spells again.** 

**Arcane Specialization:**<br/>
* **Disciplined:** You have learned to use your least powerful spells as judiciously as possible, to the point where some have become second nature

* **Spell Focus:**  At 8th level, you may sacrifice all your spells at your highest spell level in order to focus that power on a lesser spell.  At the start of the day, if you do this, you may select one spell with a level no higher than 1/8h your magus spell casting level.<br/>
At 16th level, this changes to 1/6th your magus casting level.  At 24th level, this changes to 1/4th your magus casting level.  At 32nd level, it becomes up to 1/3 your magus level.

* **Empowered:** You have learned to focus your magic when you focus your strikes.<br/>
**Vital Spell Strike:**  At 8th level, when you deliver a spell using a weapon and are using the vital strike feat, you may double the damage dice from the spell as well as your weapon.<br/>
At 16th level, you may triple the damage if you use improved vital strike.  At level 30 you may quadruple the damage if you use greater vital strike.<br/>
This double occurs before any meta-magic increases the damage dice pool.

* **Shadowed:**  You have bonded with the shadows.  Your mentors may not be excited, but the powers it gives are very real.<br/>
**Vanishing strike:**  At 8th level, when you successfully deliver a spell using a weapon, you may choose to vanish as a free action, as per the spell.  Your Magus level is treated as your caster level for the spells duration.<br/>
**Power from Shadow**:  At 12th level, you may cast Shadow Evocation as a spell-like ability.  This ability is treated as though it was a magus spell.  You may do this a number of times per day equal to half your magus level plus your intelligence modifier.

* **Enchantrix:**  You have specialized in spell manipulation, and have mastered the ability to apply meta-magic to spells you know.<br/>
**Spell Manipulation:** At 8th level, when you cast a spell, you may cast it as if it were impacted by any +1 spell level meta-magic without altering the spell level used.<br/>
At 16th level, and every 8 levels thereafter, you may increase the spell levels of meta magic without altering the spell level used to cast the spell by an additional 1.<br/>
**Greater Spell Access (Ex):** At 9th level, a magus may add 7 wizard spells to their spell list.  Every 3 levels thereafter, a magus may add 2 spells to their spell list from the wizard spell list.

**True Magus** (su): At 10th level,the magus becomes a master of spells and combat. Whenever he uses his spell combat ability, he does not need to make a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check to cast the spell defensively. Whenever the magus uses spell combat and his spell targets the same creature as his melee attacks, he can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant himself a +2 [circumstance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) on any checks made to overcome [spell resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance), or grant himself a +2 [circumstance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) on all [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) made against the target during his turn.<br/>
This bonus increases by +2 at level 17 and every 7 levels thereafter.
