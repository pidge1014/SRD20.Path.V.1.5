# Bard

Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A bard is proficient with all [simple weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#TOC-Simple-Martial-and-Exotic-Weapons-), plus the [longsword](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword), [rapier](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/rapier), [sap](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sap), [shortsword](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortsword), [shortbow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortbow), and [whip](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip). Bards are also proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

## Class Features

**Bardic Knowledge:** A bard adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all [**Knowledge**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill checks and may make all [**Knowledge**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill checks untrained.


**Bardic Performances**:A bard is trained to use the [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform) skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. <br/>   <br/>  
Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level. <br/>   <br/>  
For a list of bardic performances, see - <https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/> <br/>   <br/>  
Starting a bardic performance is a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), but it can be maintained each round as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions). Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed), [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned), knocked [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious), or otherwise prevented from taking a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.  <br/><br/>
At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) instead of a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions). 

**Versatile Performance**  : At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform) skill. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform) skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill’s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform) to substitute.<br/><br/>
The types of [Perform](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform) and their associated skills are: Act ([Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Disguise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise)), Comedy ([Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate)), Dance ([Acrobatics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics), [Fly](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly)), Keyboard Instruments ([Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate)), Oratory ([Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive)), Percussion ([Handle Animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate)), Sing ([Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive)), String ([Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy)), and Wind ([Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Handle Animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal)).

**Lore Master:** At 3rd level, the bard becomes a master of lore and can take 10 on any [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill check that he has ranks in. A bard can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the bard can take 20 on any [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill check as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). He can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 3rd

**Bardic Specialty:** At 4th level, a bard begins to specialize in their performing art of choice.  
At 4th level, a bard selects a specialty and gains the ability associated with it<br/>
* ___Dancer___ <br/>
**Graceful movements:**  At 4th level a dancer can use their grace to speed up her attacks. When making a full attack action, she may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding, as though under the effects of a [haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste)* spell. He also gains a +1 bonus on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and a +1 [dodge bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus) to AC and on [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saves. At 7th level, and every three [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. These bonuses do not stack with the [haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste)* spell. <br/>
***Dance of Fury*:** At 12th level, a dervish dancer can attack more than once as he moves while performing a battle dance. He can combine a full-attack action with a single move, taking the attacks at any point during his movement, but must move at least 5 feet between each attack. This movement provokes [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) as normal.

* ___Actor:___ <br/>
**Costumed Diva**: At 4th level, after years of being on the stage, the musician has become so used to wearing strange and cumbersome costumes for her performances that she gains medium armor proficiency and can cast bard spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. At 11th level, she gains heavy armor proficiency and can cast bard spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A multi-classed diva still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. <br/>
**Big Voice**:  You have learned to project your voice and/or instruments far beyond a normal range.  At 11th level, a bard can choose to affect a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot radius with bardic performances that affect an area. In addition, for every four levels beyond 11th, the area of such powers is increased by 10 feet (radius) or 20 feet (cone). If the power instead affects multiple creatures, it affects one additional creature than normal for every four levels beyond 11th. This does not affect powers that affect only a single creature.

* ___Comedian:___ <br/>
* **Quick Wit:**  At 4th level, a comedian may use perform comedy to perform counter-song.  In addition, you always act in a surprise round and may add half your bard level to all your initiative rolls.   <br/>
* **On the Ball:**  At 12th level, when a comedian is rolling initiative, they may use their bard class level in place of the result of their dice roll.

* ___Musician:___<br/>
* **Penetrating frequencies:**  At 4th level, you have learned to play your music in keys better at penetrating barriers.  Your music and sonic spells retain line of effect through most barriers, save lead.  This allows bardic performances, music and sonic spells to affect creatures across walls of force, planar boundaries, vacuums, and areas of magical silence.  At 4th level, your music, sonic spells, and bardic performances can ignore most barriers in a 30' radius from the performer.  This increases by 30' every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum range of the ability being used.<br/>
* **Weird Groove:** At 12th level, a musician gains this bardic performance that has a tendency to get a little weird. A  musician can use his performance to twist and snap the auras of his allies to give them aberrant abilities, usually belonging to a self from a parallel existence. These properties can be as mundane as [heightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/heighten-spell-metamagic) senses or as strange as tentacles, gills, or another head. While performing, allies gain an evolution pool equal to half the bard's level (rounded down, minimum 1). Abilities that require a minimum [summoner](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner) level use instead the musician’s level -3. For example, [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-) requires a 12th level weird musician to be given to allies.

**Compose Masterpiece:**  At 5th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a bard may create a new personal masterpiece.  The bard may select any spell from any spell list, and create a masterpiece that mirrors its effects.  Creating the masterpiece takes days equal to the spells level.   If the spell doesn't come from the bard spell list, its level can not be higher then ½ your bard level, rounded up.<br/>
Once completed, the spell may be cast as a bardic masterpiece with a cost of performance rounds per spell level.  In the case the spell has a duration, the spell has an ongoing cost of one performance round per duration increment (round/minute/hour).  This is a bardic performance for all purposes, except you may perform one masterpiece and a non masterpiece performance at the same time.

**Comparative Arcane Studies:**  At 6th level, once per day, a bard can cast any spell from the [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), [sorcerer/wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-sorcerer-and-wizard/), or [**witch**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch) spell lists from a [**scroll**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls)* or [**spellbook**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook) in hand as if it were one of his [**bard**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) spells known, expending a [**bard**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell from a [**scroll**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls)* this way does not cause the spell to vanish from the [*scroll*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls). A spell cast in this way cannot be modified by [metamagic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats).  

The bard may use this an additional time per day every 6 levels thereafter.

**Jack of All Trades:**  At 7th level, the bard can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires her to be trained.

**Versatile Knowledge:**  At 9th level, once per day, a bard may replace one of their known spells by studying a scroll containing the new bard spell for 1 hour.  This consumes the scroll.

**Adoring Fans:**At 10th level, the [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) can use his performance to convert even the toughest audience. To be affected, a target must be able to see and hear the [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target can attempt a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (DC = 10 + half the [bard’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) level + the [bard’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature succeeds at the saving throw, the [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) cannot use this ability on that creature again for 24 hours. On a failure, the creature is dominated (as [*dominate monster*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster)) for as long as the [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard) keeps playing and is charmed (as [*charm monster*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster)) for 1d4 hours thereafter.
Adoring fan is a [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting), [compulsion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion) effect that relies on audible and visual [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components).
