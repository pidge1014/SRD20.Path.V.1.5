## Class Features

**Favored Illumination (Ex):**  At 1st level, a rogue decides their prefered approach to stealth, and works to master it from there.  Will they choose to do things out in the open, relying on their charm, slight of hand and ability to distract to remain undetected.  Or perhaps they prefer dim light, enough to help them conceal a clever manuever until it is too late.   Many rogues, however, prefer to work in darkness, relying on their keen natural senses to function at a higher level than their enemies.  

At 1st level and every 6 levels thereafter, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Sleight of Hand skill checks attempted within that illumination level.  In addition, she can take 10 on any Stealth check attempted within that illumination level.  

**Trapfinding (Ex):** A rogue can use the Perception skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps.

**Rogue Talents (Ex):** As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.  
Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.  
A rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue talent.  
A complete listing of rogue talents can be found here: Rogue Talents: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/  

**Rogue Sneak Attack (Ex):**  At second level, when a rogue is flanking their opponent, or their opponent is denied their dexterity modifier, a rogue gains bonus precision damage equal to one of their ability modifiers, based on their favored illumination.
A rogue that prefers normal or bright light adds their charisma modifier as a bonus precision damage.
A rogue that prefers dim light adds their intelligence modifier as a bonus precision damage.
A rogue that prefers darkness adds their wisdom modifier as a bonus precision damage.
At 6th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this damage is again increased by the same modifier (such that at 6th level its is 2x the modifier, 11th level 3x, 16th level 4x, etc)

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 3rd level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her.

***Infiltration Styles:***  
* **Smiling through the front door:** You find the best way to get into a place your not supposed to be is to simply pretend you belong there and walk right in.

* **Hidden in the Shadows:** Provided there is a dark corner or dim ally, you have everything you need to work with to stay hidden.

* **Cracksman:** Many people believe the more expensive the lock, the safer they are.  You are happy to exploit their security.

**Trap Master** (ex): At 5th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using Disable Device, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires.

**Teritial Focus** (ex): At 6th level,

**Evasion** (ex): At 7th level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Advanced Tricks** (ex): At 8th level, a rogue may select advanced rogue tricks when they select a rogue trick.

**Greater Uncanny Dodge** (ex): At 9th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.

This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her.

**Scourge of life** (su): At 10th level, a rogue has learned to make the most of their strikes.  They can now deal precision damage to any foe that is normally immune to it.  In addition, a rogue with this talent multiplies their rogue sneak attack precision damage on a critical hit.
