# Witch

Whether it be from desperation, devotion, or just plain curiosity, you have formed a pact with an unknown power.  Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware.

While there are some witches that learn the arts on their own, the vast majority were apprentices to their villages witch and heir to their steading after the senior witches passing.

People from large cities often fear witches, for good reason, but they have a long reputation of serving the greater good in rural communities.  Services might include helping birth a child, officiating a marriage, settling disputes through arbitration, and of course, sampling the first batch of beer to ensure its not dangerous.
Their strange magic can often mirror the powers granted by the Dark Pantheon.  These pacts, in fact, predate the rise of the evil realms, but few city dwellers are educated enough to know this

## Class Features

**Spell casting:**

A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the [witch spell list](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-list-witch). A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.

To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against a witch’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch’s [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier.

A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on **Table: Witch**. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score (see [**Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#Table-Ability-Modifiers-and-Bonus-Spells)).

A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.

Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on **Table: Witch** under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to [metamagic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats) feats for example, are expended normally.

**Witch's Familiar (Ex):**  At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the [wizard’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard) arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the [Witch’s Familiar section](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch/witch-s-familiar).

A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch’s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st level spells of the witch’s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual.

**Patron Spells**
At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand.

At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch’s patron adds new spells to a witch’s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.

[See a complete list of witch patrons here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch/witch-patrons#Patron_Themes_and_Spells).

**Hex:** At 1st level, a witch may select one Hex.  At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch may select an additional hex.   At 10th level the Hex list is expanded to include major hexes.  At 18th level, it includes grand hexes.

Unless otherwise noted, a hex is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  The save is 10+1/2 the witch's level + witch's intelligence modifier.

<https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch/hexes/hexes/>

True witches do not cackle, and in fact the term is used to describe a witch who embraces the evil nature of their patron.  The use of the cackle hex is considered evil and will impact alignment each use.


**Second Thoughts:**  Witches are clever and are able to analyze not only their own thoughts, but, how they are thinking them.  At 3rd level, a witch had become adept at thinking about the way they are thinking.   Once per day, they may re-roll any intelligence or wisdom skill or ability check.   They may do this again at 11th level and every 8 levels thereafter.

**Hex Trading:**  At 4th level, once per day as a full round action, a witch can bind a hex she knows to a feather, bead, or small token.  Any creature holding this can use that hex once as if using a potion.    If a hex has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated.  You gain an additional use of this at level 8 and every 4 levels thereafter.

**Headology:**  Witches are persuasive, able to dissuade even the  least talkative opponent.  At 6th level, a witch can insert emotions into the mind of a single target as part of her speech.  She gains a +2 bonus to diplomacy, bluff and intimidate checks, when not acting against their alignment.
In addition, she selects one of the following keywords: Illusion(Phantasms), Fear, and Charm.  Any time she casts spells with the listed descriptor, you can choose to increase the save DC of the associated saves by 1.    She can increase a spell DC this way a number of times per day equal to half her witch level.
The bonus to spell DC increases by 1 and diplomacy/bluff check increases by 2 at level 9 and every 3 levels thereafter.<br/>
Regardless of their selection, their spells penetrate any immunities their target(s) may have to mind effecting spells and abilities they may have that use their selected keyword.  Enemies immune to mind effecting spells recieve a +10 bonus to their save.  This bonus is reduced by 1 every 3 levels thereafter until it reaches 0.
If a witch uses a mind effecting spell, the effect and intent matters.  If a witch who is good aligned uses this power to commit an act of evil, it will always cause a major alignment hit.  Likewise, if an evil witch used her powers to end a dispute non violently in a way that only hurts herself, she may also trigger an alignment hit.  It is very hard for a witch to use their own emotion in a spell without it impacting her in return.  A witch constantly changing alignments will eventually shift towards chaotic as well.  Ultimately, how using this ability impacts your alignment should be agreed upon with your GM.

**First Sight:** You have become adept at seeing things for what they are, rather than what you'd like them to be or what others are telling you they are seeing.  At 8th level, once per day after failing a saving throw vs an illusion spell, you may spend an immediate action and cast True Seeing on yourself, as per the spell.   This does not cost a spell slot and has a caster level of your witch level.   

At level 16, and every 8 levels thereafter, you may use this ability an additional time per day.  In addition, you may spend two uses of this power to instead cast Greater True Seeing on yourself as a spell like ability with a caster level equal to your witch level.

**Reach Out:**  At 9th level, a witch has become adept at feeling the emotional flow of the world around her.  She may spend a full round action to begin concentrating and reach out with her mind.  While doing this, she feel the emotions of any creature within 10 yards per witch caster level.

In addition, if there were any great outbursts of emotions in the past 24 hours, the witch can sense the imprint it left on the buildings themselves.  While joy and happiness can be fleeting, the impacts of a tragedy often linger longer.  

**Symbiosis:** At 10th level, a witch gains the ability to meld or unmeld with her familiar as a standard action. The symbiosis causes the witch to adopt some basic physical features of the familiar and grants additional abilities based on the witch's level. The witch gains all speed and abilities the familiar possesses listed under beast shape 1.
The witch gains all natural attacks the familiar may posses.  In addition, the familiar does not lose their seperate initiative.  However, on the familiar's turn, they do not gain access to the witch's spells, spell-like, or supernatural abilities, but do retain their own.

At 15th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the abilities available increases to the next version of beast shape to a max of beast shape 4.
