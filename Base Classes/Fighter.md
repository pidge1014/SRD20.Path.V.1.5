**Fighter**

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

**Bonus Feats:**  At first level, and every two levels thereafter, the fighter gains a bonus combat feat.


**Armor Training (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, whenever a fighter is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum dexterity bonus allowed by 1.  These bonuses increase by 1 every 4 levels thereafter.

**Fighting Style (Ex):**  At level 2, a fighter selects one fighting style.

`	`**Defensive Expert:**  At level 2, when you are using a shield, your shield bonus is increased by 1.  This bonus 	increases by an additional one every two levels thereafter.  

`	`At level 6, as a move action, you may grant your shield bonus to one adjacent ally. This bonus stacks with any 	existing shield bonuses your ally may have.  You may apply this bonus to an additional ally every 6 levels 	thereafter.  At level 18, this may be done as a swift action.

`	`**Dirty Fighter:** At 2nd level, whenever your opponent is flanked or denied their dexterity modifier to AC, your 	attacks deal an extra 1d6 precision damage.   This bonus increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter.

`	`At 6th level, once per day, when you threaten a critical, you may choose to roll any number of your precision 	damage dice as part of your confirmation roll to confirm the critical hit, rather than as damage.  You may do this a 	second time per day at level 9 and every three levels thereafter.

`	`**Great Weapon Fighter:** At 2nd level, you gain the ability to fully commit to an attack, making them nearly 	unstoppable. Once per day, when making a power attack with a two handed weapon, you may choose to replace the 	+3 bonus damage from power attack for an addition set of weapon dice for each +3 damage traded (example, if 	your weapon deals 1d12 damage, you may add an additional 1d12 to your damage roll, instead of +3).  You may do 	this an additional time per day every two levels thereafter.

`	`At 10th level, attacks you make with two handed weapons ignore the first 5 points of DR.  A great weapon fighter 	ignores 5 additional DR every 10 levels thereafter.

`	`**Ranged Expert:** At 2nd level, you gain a +2 bonus to hit and +1 damage when making an attack with a ranged 	weapon. In addition, you may select a bonus feat you qualify for that has Point Blank Shot as a prerequisite.

`	`At 8th level, and every 6 levels thereafter, you may select an additional feat with Point Blank Shot as a prerequisite, 	and the bonus to ranged attacks increase by +2 to hit and +1 damage

**Reckless Warrior:** At 2nd level, you gain the ability to Rage like a barbarian. A reckless warrior can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 2nd level, a reckless warrior can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier.

At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-), such as those gained from rage and spells like [*bear’s endurance*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bear-s-endurance), do not increase the total number of rounds that a reckless warrior can rage per day. A reckless warrior can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.

While in rage, a reckless warrior gains a +4 bonus to her [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-), as well as a +2 bonus on [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saves. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class). The bonus to her s[trength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and constitution increases by +4, her bonus to Will increases by +2, and penalty to Armor Class increases by -2, every 8 levels thereafter.

The increase to [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) grants the fighter extra hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points). While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-, [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)-, or [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)-based skills (except [Acrobatics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics), [Fly](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate), and [Ride](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride)) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A reckless warrior can end her rage as a free action and is [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued) after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A reckless warrior cannot enter a new rage while [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued) or [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted) but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a reckless warrior falls [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious), her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.

At 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, The Reckless Warrior learns a rage power.  Her barbarian level is treated as her fighter level for this class feature.  A complete list of rage powers can be found here: [Rage Powers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers)

`	`-When wearing armor or using a shield, the fighter gains DR 5/- .  If the fighter gains DR /- from another source, 	this increases that DR by 5.   If this is taken more than once, the fighter's DR is increased by 5 each time.
`	`-A fighter may choose a weapon in from a weapon group which they are trained in.  All attacks made with 	that weapon type have their critical range increased by 1.   This modifies the base value of the weapon and 	is multiplied by effects like Keen or Improved Critical.
`	`If this is taken more than once, you may choose to increase the weapon's critical multiplier by 1 or gain a +10 	bonus to confirm critical hits with a weapon you have already selected.  The second bonus to confirm critical hits 	may be taken more than once with the same weapon and stacks.
