# Druid

Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

## Class Features

**Nature Bond:** At first level, a druid makes a bond with nature.  This may take one of two forms.  
The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. Druids also have access to a set Terrain Domains. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.
In addition, she gains a familiar associated with one of the domains selected.  The familiar may possess the elemental familiar archetype.

The druid may also form a bond with an animal companion.  
List of companion options here:  <https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices>**
Only animals from the core book,[**PZO1110**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601251505/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601251505&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20) , are allowed by default.<br/>
In addition, a druid may not wear unnatural clothing, such as studded  or metal armor.  Doing so will result in all class features failing to function until the offending clothing is removed.

The item can be naturally refined, such as silk, wool, and cotton , but all components must have been part of nature, as per a druid's armor proficiency.  Smelting and distructive processes are forbidden.

**Nature Sense**:A druid gains a +2 bonus on [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge)** (nature) and [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival)** checks.

**Wild empathy** : A druid may use diplomacy to influence the attitude of an animal. The druid may roll 1d20 and add her druid level and charisma modifier to determine the Wild Empathy check.   Generally, influencing an animal takes 1 full minute, and otherwise functions as the diplomacy skill.   This can be performed against a magical beast with an intelligence higher than 2, but at a -4 penalty. 

**Woodland Stride:** When moving through any natural terrain, it is never treated as difficult terrain.

**Wild Shape:** At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or plant type. This ability functions like the [**beast shape I**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape) spell or plant shape 1, except as noted here. 
The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.<br/>
A druid loses her ability to speak while in [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)<br/>
A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter<br/>
At 7th level, a druid may shapeshift into an animal one step different from its own and the version of beast and plant shape increase by one.  Both of these again increase by one at 13th level and every three levels thereafter.  

**Resist Nature's Lure:**  At 5th level, a druid gains a +3 bonus vs spells and spell like abilities cast by creatures of the fey sub-type.  This bonus also applies to all spells that target plants, such as entangle.  This increases by +3 every 6 levels thereafter.  

**Many Lives:**  Druids are fully committed to the karmic cycle of nature. At 6th level, if a druid is killed, she may automatically [*reincarnate*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reincarnate) (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using [*locate object*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-object) as a [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-). If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains [**dead**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) and does not [*reincarnate*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reincarnate). The many lives ability does not function if the reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect.

A druid cannot be raised from the [**dead**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.

**Venom Immunity:**  You are immune to all poison.

**Natural Speciality:**  At 8th level, you have specialized in your bond with nature.  You may select one of the following:
* **Arcane Ritualist:** You have focused on infusing your magic into rituals.  At 8th level you gain an additional spell slot for each spell level you possess.  You may prepare these spells as ritual inscriptions onto yourself, your companion, or your familiar.  Doing this acts like a command word activated magic item, and requires the same action as the spell stored to activate.  Any targets of the spell need to be selected at the time the spell is inscribed.  It is possible for an unintelligent animal to trigger a spell inscribed on them, provided they have learned the speak trick.
* **Animal Sanctuary:** For you, one companion was not enough.  At 8th level, you gain a second animal companion.  This companion begins at your animal companion's current level -3.  If you did not already have an animal companion, it instead begins at your druid level -3.  Any time you gain a level in a class other than druid that gives a level to your animal companion, it only applies to one of your animal companions.
* **Master of Shapes:** At 8th level, using your wild shape power is now a free action.  In addition, you may now use wild shape to transform into a magical beast.

**Living speech:**  A druid is capable of communicating with any living creature, up to the limits of the creatures intelligence.  This functions as true speech, but for living creatures only.

**Master of Shapes:** At 10th level, she has become a master of shapeshifting.   When using wildshape, you still gain the attribute bonuses associated with your size change, but none of the other benefits of beast form 1 as you now gain more of the creatures base powers.  Wildshape is alterted in the following ways:
*  You may take the form of any animal whose CR is lower than your total hit dice.
*  While shapeshifted, you may choose to use your shapes physical attributes in place of your own, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.
*  You gain all the forms supernatural and extraordinary abilities, both attacks and qualities.
*  If you meet the prerequisites for a feat while using wild shape but not in your normal form, you may take the feat, but only benefit from it when its prerequisites are being met.
