# Scout

Ever just one step ahead of danger, scouts bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents.

Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered scouts, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck.

## Class Features

**Skirmish (Ex):** A scout relies on mobility to create weaknesses in an enemies defense. She deals an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. The extra damage applies only to attacks made after the scout has moved at least 10 feet. The skirmish ability cannot be used while mounted. The extra damage applies until the start of their next turn. 
This extra damage increases by 1d8 for every three levels gained above 1st (2d8 at 4th, 3d8 at 7th, etc).<br/>
Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet.  This distance increases by 10 feet for every dice added.
A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

If this movement was caused by a different creature, the round the movement occurred will not end until the creature acts again on their next initiative.

**Scouting Focus**: Starting at 6th level, a scout has become more focused on what they have spent their career doing.  You may select one of the following focuses.

She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.<br/>

-**Spellstrike**: At 12th level, you can spend an immediate action to make an attack against an enemy casting a spell, which you have identified, within 60 feet.  If the attack hits, the spell is interupted. <br/>

**Camouflage (Ex):** Beginning at 7th level, a scout can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural or urban terrain.  She loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

**Alarmingly Fast (Ex):**  Your hours traveling cross country has not just taught you to travel faster than your allies, but more.  At 8th level, on your turn, you gain an additional move action.  If this action is used for movement, the scout can to travel up to ¼ of their total movement speed (round up to next 5ft increment), provoking as normal, or on a 5 foot shift.  This move action may also be spent on any ability, spell, or spell like ability the scout may possess.
