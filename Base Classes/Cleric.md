**Cleric**

You are an emissary of a deities divine works. Your life has been spent in devotion to the tenets of your religion and the philosophies that inspire them.  In return, your god has blessed you with great power, but absolutely expect results.  A cleric must devoutly worship a god.  

Before the gods ascended, religion and non magical priests existed, but true clerics did not.

**Alignment:**  A cleric's alignment must be in line with their deities core beliefs, as they will be expected to pursue them throughout their career. There is no official rule for your alignment other than this, work with your GM to determine there is no conflict or approval to play a character with this internal struggle.

**Ex Clerics:** A cleric who ignores the tenets of their deity runs the risk of loosing their favor.  Following violating enough minor tenets or their unbreakable tenet, a cleric may lose access to some or all cleric class features, per GM discretion.  This is not quickly reversible and most ex-clerics' crisis of faith causes them to retire from adventuring.
The cleric will have to slowly prove themselves worthy of their god's favor once again.  While the exact requirements are up to the GM, it should not happen faster than the time it takes the player to gain levels equal to half the number of levels they had when their god abandoned them. (max of 5)

**Aura (Ex):**A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment.   


**Channel Energy (Ex)**:Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.

A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to creatures blessed by the Lower Pantheon, known as The Cursed, or to heal creatures who are not. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal the cursed. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. 
Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level + the cleric’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.

A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.

**Domains (Su):** A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two [domains](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains).

Each [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) grants a number of [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains)s in that slot. If a [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her [domain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains) spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.

In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action.

- A complete listing of cleric domains can be found here: [Cleric Domains](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains)

**Spontaneous Casting:** A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).

An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy (see channel energy).

**Personal Focus (Su) :** A cleric can follow their god in many ways, and its ultimately up to them to choose how.  At 3rd level a cleric chooses their personal theological pursuits.

**Warrior Priest:**  You have spent your days of worship preparing yourself for the dangers of the world, not just spiritually,  but physically.  Your BAB from cleric levels can not be lower than the number of cleric levels you have.  In addition, if you ingrain this class feature, your BAB bonus is equal to your character level, excluding any non cleric levels gained before ingraining this class feature.

In addition, your cleric levels count as fighter levels for the purposes of feat requirements.

**Intellectual:**  Research and the search for a greater understanding of your god drives you.  Your studies have lead you to learn how to create a direct conduit to the divine realms of your deity.  You gain a familiar, in addition to any existing types, the familiar is considered an outsider.

At 8th level, you may commune with your deity as per the spell, via your familiar, once per day.

At 12th level, when preparing spells, you may prepare one spell as though you had applied the familiar spell meta-magic.  You may prepare an additional spell like this one more time each day at level 16 and every 4 levels thereafter.   

**Chaplain:** Preaching and sharing your faith are among the things you focus on the most. When you use your channel energy or fervor class features and would heal an ally, you may roll 50% more dice, round up.  These additional dice apply to the entire effect.

In addition, at 8th level, when you prepare your spells you spend time sharing your love for your deity with your allies.  You may select a number of allies equal to your charisma modifier.  They gain the benefits of one of your domain powers or blessings.  If the ability has uses per day, they may use it a number of times equal to ½ of your charisma modifier.

**Blessings (Su):** At 4th level, a cleric gains the minor blessing of one of her domains(as the warpriest class feature).  She uses her cleric level as her warpriest level for determining the effects of the blessing.

Every 6 levels thereafter, a cleric may gain a new minor blessing in one of their domains or the major blessing in a domain they already posses the minor blessing for.

These blessings work as written, ignoring any mention of a maximum at 20th level.

**Fervor (Su):** At 5th level, a cleric can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds or harm foes with his touch. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his cleric level + his [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) modifier. By expending one use of this ability, a cleric (or one who worships a good deity) can touch a creature to heal it of 2d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 3 cleric levels he possesses above 5th.

Using this ability is a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) (unless the cleric targets himself, in which case it’s a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions)). Alternatively, the cleric can use this ability to harm an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature, dealing the same amount of damage he would otherwise heal with a melee [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks). Using fervor in this way is a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) that provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).

As a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a cleric can expend one use of this ability to cast any one cleric spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target only the cleric, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way ignore somatic components and do not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). The cleric does not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.

**Inspired Healing (Ex):** At 6th level, as a swift action whenever a cleric casts a cure/inflict spell that includes an ally, the cleric can infuse a single included ally with inspired vigor.  For a number of rounds equal to half your cleric level, the ally's attack rolls gain a sacred bonus equal to half the clerics level.

The cleric may use this ability once per day at 6th level, and can include an additional ally and gains an additional use per day for every 4 cleric levels thereafter.

In addition, when a cleric uses their channel energy or fervor class feature, they may spend two uses of the other feature and o add its dice to it's effect.

**Sacred Weapons(Su)** : At 8th level,  a cleric may spend a swift action to grant a weapon they are holding divine power.  For minutes equal to your cleric level, your weapon gains a +2 enhancement bonus.  This stacks with any existing bonus your weapon may have and can be used to enhance the weapon with special abilities.  Also for the duration, the weapon pierces any DR from an outsider whose alignment is in opposition to your god's (law vs chaos, good vs evil).
In addition, if this is your deity's sacred weapon, you may choose to increase the size of the weapon by one step for the purposes of damage done, or increase its critical range by 1.  This increase temporarily modifies the base weapon and occurs before effects like Keen and improved critical feat.

At level 12 and every 4 thereafter, the enhancement bonus to a weapon they are holding increases by +1.

A cleric that wields more than one weapon can apply this to both weapons with one swift action, but each second that passes counts for two for the purposes of measuring ability usage.

**Divine Protection:**  You may add your charisma modifier to all your saving throws.

**Proxy** (su): At 10th level, the cleric begins to forges a direct, personal connection to her deity. She knows instinctively whether her deity would approve or disapprove of a given course of action or idea (though deities rarely bother to form opinions about overly mundane or trivial events). 
In addition, at level 10 and every 10 levels thereafter, she can select an additional domain from the list offered by her deity to symbolize this growing connection.






**Deities of The Continent.** (there are many more, these are here as examples)  Deities are all considered to have any subdomains with their listed domains.
