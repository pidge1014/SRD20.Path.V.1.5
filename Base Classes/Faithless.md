**Faithless**

When the first god ascended into the sky, some watched with wonder and joy.  Others recoiled in horror as they watched zealots enthusiastically giving up their own will and self determination.  They did not see figures worthy of worship, they saw people just like themselves achieve the possible.

You have devoted your life to the study of yourself and unlocking your full potential, both mind and body.
Publicly, the Order of the Faithless are considered a religious order.  A collection of individuals who consider it unreasonable to put faith in any single god, when there are so many.  In reality, they view the gods as an existential threat to free will.

**Pragmatic Combat:**  You gain Improved Unarmed Strike and Whip Mastery as a bonus feat.  In addition, you are well trained with the traditional weapons of the faithless.  A knife and a rope.  You may treat any rope as a whip, although you must deal non lethal damage.

**Divine Resistance:**  At 1st level, and every 3 levels thereafter, gain a +1 bonus to saves vs divine spells.

**Spell casting:**

A faithless casts psychic spells drawn from the [psychic class’s spell list](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/psychic).  Faithless are not capable of casting conjuration(Summoning) spells.  She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The [Difficulty Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) for a saving throw against a psychic’s spell is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the psychic’s [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier.

A Faithless can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on below in a table.  In addition, she receives [bonus spells per day](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters) if she has a high [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score.

Unlike a faithless's spells per day, the number of spells a faithless knows isn’t affected by her [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score.

At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a faithless can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the faithless loses the old spell in exchange for the new one.

The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the faithless's class list that the faithless can cast.

Unlike most casters, a Faithless casting spells has immediate repercussions on their mind, and therefor, their defenses.  Any time a faithless casts a spell, they receive a -1 stacking penalty to all their saves for hours equal to the spell level, with a minimum duration of 1 round.  There is no minimum value for a save.  After 6 hours of rest, this penalty is removed.

**Mental Specialization:**  At 2nd level, a faithless picks an area of focus to specialize in.  The faithless may choose to focus on their prowess in close combat, battlefield control, or mastery their psychic powers.

**Close Combat:**  When  making an attack or full attack against an enemy you are adjacent to, you may choose to forgo a single attack in order to do more damage on your other attacks.  If you do this, you may add the damage the sacrificed attack to all your remaining attacks.  In addition, a faithless gains a bonus combat feat.  A faithless gains an additional combat feat every 3 levels and may forgo an additional attack and apply its damage to each remaining attacks every 10 levels thereafter.

At level 12, once per turn, on your turn, you may cast one conjuration(teleport) spell as a free action. You cast an additional time per turn every 10 levels thereafter.

At level 20, once per day, and every 10 levels thereafter, you may cast a conjuration(teleport) spell as an immediate action

**Battlefield Control:**  When using a weapon in the flail group to perform a combat maneuver, you may treat your reach as if it was +5'. In addition, a faithless gains a bonus combat feat that contains the word whip or modifies a combat maneuver.  A  faithless gains an additional feat every two levels thereafter and an additional 5' of reach every 10 levels thereafter.

At level 18, you are treated as if you were one size larger for the purposes of combat maneuvers.   This increases by one size category every 12 levels thereafter.

**Psychic Mastery:**  You have focused on bettering your mind.  You gain at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you may gain an additional spell known of any level you can cast.  In addition, you gain one meta-magic feat, item creation feat, or spell mastery feat.  You gain an additional feat every 5 levels thereafter.

At level 20, your first spell per round does not count towards your penalty to saving throws.  This applies to an additional spell per round every 10 levels thereafter.


**Breathing Exercises (Ex):**  Starting at 3rd level, as a free action, you may enter a meditative combat state.  During the duration, when you take an action that includes making an attack, while unarmed or using a knife or whip, you gain an additional attack against the same target at your highest bonus, but must take a -2 penalty to all attack rolls.  

If the triggering action has additional effects, the bonus attack does not also apply those effects.  You may only get one additional attack even if your attack action triggers multiple attacks.   When you make a full attack, this extra attack stacks with haste and similar effects.
Maintaining this meditative state requires concentration, which you may maintain as a free action each turn, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your faithless level.
You may do this for a number of minutes equal to your faithless level per day, in increments no smaller than one minute.

While performing this maneuver, your BAB from faithless levels is treated as your levels of faithless.   In addition, if this class feature is ingrained, then you BAB can not be less than your character level, excluding any non faithless levels gained before ingraining this class feature, when using this ability.

**Ancestors Memory (Ex):** Starting at 5th level, a faithless begins to learn how to tap into the collective memory of their ancestors. At the start of each day, they may choose to spend an hour in quiet contemplation with their ancestors.  During which, they may select a skill to be considered a class skill, and may spend additional skill points in any skill, equal to their faithless level.  Normal rules for spending skill points still apply when spending these points.  

This bonus lasts until a faithless chooses to reallocate these points using the same ritual.

**Improved Pragmatic Combat:**  At 6th level, you gain Improved Whip Mastery as a bonus feat.

**Voice of your Ancestors (Ex):** At 7th level, you may choose to have your ancestors assist you when attempting to convince others. When you make a diplomacy, bluff, or any charisma based social roll, you may roll twice and take the higher result.

You may only use this ability once against a target every 24 hours.

**Greater Pragmatic Combat:**  At 8th level, you gain greater whip mastery as a bonus feat.

**Mental Fortitude:**  Starting at 9th level, your mastery of your own body has reached a chemical level.  You are now immune to all poison and disease while not unconscious. They may also add their intelligence modifier to all their saves.

**Simulflow**: At 10th level, a faithless with significant enough control over their own body, can learn to directly control the way they think and simultaneously maintain several threads of consciousness at a time.  

At 10th level, and ever 10 levels thereafter, a faithless gains an additional standard action on their turn, which can only be used to perform a purely mental action.
In place of this mental action, a faithless may choose to use this additional thread of consciousness to concentrate on an ongoing effect.  If they are concentrating in the back of their mind, only rendering them unconscious can interrupt the concentration.

In addition, if they are under any mind effecting or fear effects, they may use this action to make a new save against that effect, even if additional saves are not normally allowed.
