The elves of the outer islands have always enjoyed a life of freedom largely in thanks to their armies, spear headed by the dreaded arcane vanguard.  

Trained in Leafflower, these elves have perfected the ability to minimize their movements during spell casting, and their most powerful have learned to remove movement from the process entirely.  This results in their Arcane Vanguard legions to be fully armed, throwing spells and arrows with great prowess.

The city of Leafflower itself was once home to a great and ancient dragon, who was sadly slain by an ancient enemy reborn in the depths of the Abyss.  While some dragons still reside on the hillsides, the city is no longer governed by the dragons and the elven rulers who managed the day to day activities took over larger responsibilities.
