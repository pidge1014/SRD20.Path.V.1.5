# The Continent: Players Guide

## Pathfinder 1.5e
**Character Creation**  At this point, the base classes present represent a framework for classes, but not every option.  Everything from Pathfinder 1e is technically available in some form, but may require some conversion to stay inline with the intended goals of 1.5.
* **A Character is built in two parts, body and soul** A character may be born to a great destiny, the ten thousanth rebirth of an ancient soul. Or, born under a dark sign and fights against the uluring power of the shadows.  Just as each character trains in wizardry or the martial arts, each character has a unique soul that drives them in this world.
Apart from selecting your race and class, you will be selecting a soul for your character
* **Character Options** Characters begin at level 4
* **Soul Options** In addition to the options listed, there are a large number of valid additional options not listed. 

## Character Rules

Characters will use a 25 point buy for ability scores, start at level 4, with 10,500 gold in wealth.  There are no rules for how this money is spent, nor are there limits for who your character can be.
The continient is 50,000 miles accross, and while Flintfall's Splinter is small, the City of Peace connects it to the world.  There is no reason the gunslinging dwarven airship captain and his crew can't find themselves there, even if there is no local equivalent.  Any archetype or class from pathfinder 1.e should be considered available.

Also of note, your race comes with a small number of racials and 20 character points to spend for you to clarify exactly what you physically inherited.

Note: You can play a pathfinder 1.0 class as written, but many do not have features that will scale well if ingrained.  If someone wants to play one of these, thats fine, we may just need to adjust a class feature or add one from an archetype that will scale.

##  Bedrock League

Where you were for most of your life, is up to you.  However, for the past few months you have been taking jobs as a pebble of the Bedrock League in the newly established town of Deepfyord.  Taking jobs to explore and tame this new part of the world.  
The work has paid well, and not been too dangerous for your tastes.  Often, you are only asked to scout a location or research a local topic unknown to the greater world, and then report back.  Perhaps after you have proven yourself longer, the more dangerous tasks will be offered.  But, based on the stories you hear in the pubs at night, you are far better off missing out.  
The Bedrock League was originally formed several years after the scar was born.  Named after the dwarven capitol, they were tasked to find, they were founded by a small group of less than 30 dwarves, on the far Northern edge of Flintfall Mountains.  These dwarves were the sacred guards of a great dwarven treasure, but were now cut off from their other cities, after finding their long underground roads had been consumed and corrupted by darkness.  
Desparate to find their kin, but far too few in number to explore themselves, the dwarves began to use their wealth to hire exploreres and adventurers to seek out their kin.   The work was extremely dangerous, but the pay was more than enough to draw a great deal of attention and talent.  
Large contracts were offered for anyone who could reach the other dwarven cities, and eventually, the adventurers succeeded.  Often not just returning with news, but escourting the trapped survivors out.  As it turned out, the scar only formed where the Lord of Strength had faithful, and very few loyal to him were found amoung the dwarves.  
When the old dwarven capitol of Bedrock was finally reached, the organization had grown wealthy and strong enough to not just rescue the inhabitants, but fully secure the passageways to reconnect it with the world.  
Today, there are far more than the Flintfall Dwarves who patronize the brave explorers of the Bedrock League.   The league, however, is typically very careful before taking on and agreeing to do work.  Even from longstanding patrons.  Wealth has given them the luxury of caution and patience.  
As a junior member, your jobs are often for the league itself, looking into a mission before anyone too vaulable is put at risk.


## Classes summary in the setting  
* **Fighter** :Fighters are the ultimate martial combatants.  They are the guards of the world and make up the rank and file of any standing army.  They are the best at using weapons to bring death, but at the cost of mobility. Fighters are the only class that does not have any increased action economy and will need help to stay in full attack range.  When there, enemies will disapear quickly.  
* **Bard** : Versatile to the extreme.  They work as town healers, storytellers and leaders. Bards can do a little bit of everything, including having access to other classes spell lists, but don't really do anything the best.  Masterpieces have been rewritten and are actually useful.  
* **Druid** : Druids have a long history as the great healers of the world, as they predate clerics by thousands of years. Druids are also the greatest of shapeshifters and have mastered truely taking another form.  Druids are arcane spell casters, as they predate the existence of gods. (Fey magic is basically primal magic, but technically arcane)  This has no effect on their spellcasting, as long as their armor is entirely natural.  
* **Ranger** : The ranger is a versatile combatant, behind the fighter in raw damage, but potent none the less.  But, when paired with their loyal companion, they are a dangerous addition to any party.  
* **Magus** : Blending magic and attacks, the magus can compete with any class in raw damage, depending on what spells they decide to cast on their turn.  Magus is largely unchanged in terms of base mechanics, but now scales their actions better.  
* **Scout** : When an army, or group of any size, needs to send someone to take a look, that person is usually a scout.  Scouts are masters of movement, and typically possess the skills needed to infiltrate whatever is nessesary.  
* **Cleric** : If you are willing to follow a church's strick and often strange dogma, there can be great power found.  Clerics are restricted in following their god's rules, and will lose some powers for even small deviations. Assuming they are in their god's good graces, they can wade into battle with martial prowess, focus on spell casting, or become the ultimate support character.(warpriest was merged into cleric, and they have a full BAB option)  
* **Faithless** : Faithless rely on their mental accuity to cast spells, and survive them.  They are the undisputed kings of action economy, but are far more battlefield controller than the type of magical threat brought by a wizard or witch.  Faithless are technically the monks of the setting, but gave up most of their monestic traditions long ago.  (there are true monks in this world, but monastic vows and their extremely disciplined lifestyles rarely coexist with adventuring.  pathfinder monks are technically available but will likely be relabled as a sect of faithless )  
* **Wizard** : A Wizard is a powerful student of the natural fonts of magic.  Which one they specialize in will often shape them in strange ways.  
* **Witch** : Where Wizards specialize in understanding magic intellictually, witches work to understand magic emotionally.  It is often said a witch could bend a rock to her will.  

# The Gods

On the very first day an intelligent creature stirred on the Continent, there were no gods in the universe.  The raw powers of the universe existed, but remained uncontrolled and unfocused.  With the help of magic, creatures evolved into the wild and the unexplainable variety of life that is found today.

It was not until Benjamin the Conqueror died that the world knew their first god.  Benjamin was far from the most powerful individual to be alive or have lived, nor was he the most revered living being. But, at the moment of his death, a blindingly bright light erupted upwards and ascended with the faith of his citizens and became the first god of the High Pantheon. In doing so, the first of the outer planes were created, now known as the Upper Outer Planes.

Many other gods followed over the years, and their stories have played major roles in shaping both the world and the Outer Planes they reside in. Hundreds of planes came into form, some mischeveous, but none were truly evil. But, perhaps no other god, including Benjamin, shaped the world like the ascendance of Yrill.

1 in 10,000 children born are found to be fundamentally tied to one of the sources of magic.  Yrill was born bound to all three.  This would not nessessarily have been a curse, if not for the influence of a young fae, a hobkins named Tifzi.  Yrill gathered a massive following as he built his empire, but many theologians and clerics theorized at the time that no one as cruel and malicious as him would ever draw worship in a comparable way to a benevolent ruler.  But, on the day of his death, when the power of divine faith began to manifest him into a god and his followers proved the priesthoods of the world wrong, the gods of the Upper Pantheon stepped in to reward their faithful by blocking his ascent.  

While they succeeded in keeping Yrill from the realms of the Upper Pantheon, the will of the faithful could not be denied.   A strange dark energy was born, its existence a mockery of creation itself, and it ripped through the land twisting everything it touched.  The Scar, as it is commonly known, consumed all of Yrill's massive kingdom. His faithful servants transformed into terrible creatures and the rest turned to shadows.  The destruction rippled accross the continent and its presence stains the world to this day.

The hellish lower outer planes of the Low Pantheon were also born that day.  The twisted and dark realms that inhabit the Low Pantheon, and their residents, are powered by the antithesis of creation, commonly known as negative energy.  While devils and demons powered by this energy are technically alive, the living world and positive energy of life is as toxic to them as the Scar is to mortals.


## The Continent

The Continent is large, one might say, almost unnessesarily large.   It spans just under 50,000 miles across at its longest point.  Before the Scar, a great wizard could teleport from one end to the other without issue, and the world was a very different place then it has become today.

When the Scar formed, it uncoiled in all directions.  Entire cities were enveloped and their inhabitants destroyed, if they were lucky. As devastating as this was, learning that this new horror functions in contrast to magic as they knew it, was worse.

While teleportation is taken for granted as instant, the caster is in fact traveling through one of the non-physical planes.  It's typically the astral plane, but can often be the ethereal, and certain traditions have learned to tap into shadow and timeless planes.  These facts were not well known before the Scar, because all of these planes were continious and the spells simply worked. But in the Scar, many of these planes do not continuously exist, and if they do, it is often not in the same way.

Any time a magic user casts a long range teleport to an unknown location, there is always a small chance they will suffer a failure along the way.  Most magic users of the world have made work arounds to this problem using fixed portals between reliable destinations.  Outside of that, many wizarding orders have accumulated vast notes on the regions around the scar, with the safest suggestions for travel.  Druids, on the other hand, have almost entirely solved this problem, for themselves at least.  They have created groves of blueleaf trees in most major cities of the world to assist in travel. This practice predates the formation of the scar, and was by far the least disrupted form of travel.

But despite all efforts, there are entire civilizations that have been largely cut off from the world due to the scar forming around them. Thankfully to the world, there was one civilization that decided to call that ruined land home.  The City of Peace rests nearly in the center of the Scar, settled by a group of refuges unwilling to be servants to another ruler for a place to settle or bring war to take it.  The warded roads to this city lead to the edges of the Scar and are always built strait, to ensure anyone using the roads can safely teleport to the end.  There is however, one catch.  The powerful magic used to ward the stone pathway from the Scar also prevents the malicious of heart from using them.  The magic doesn't care if you are justified in your hatred or not, it will turn you away all the same.

Over the many years, the City of Peace has continued to built roads, both literal and with diplomacy, to each of these cut off civilizations.  This has resulted in the City of Peace being one of the few places in the continent that actually has contact with the entire continent and in turn has become a well known travel hub.  The City itself has a much more powerful version of the protective ward on it, as it was cast by the goddess of peace before she ascended.

## Flintfall's Splinter

Flintfall's Splinter, is perhaps the most secluded of all of these lands to be cut off from the continent by the Scar and will be home to the start of the campaign.  

Lying in the South Eastern part of the continent, the Scar stretches deep into the sea at its boarders and nearly envelopes the small peninsula.  But buried here were some of the continents great treasures.

## Dragons, Naga, and the early 'gods' of the world

Life evolved on the continent much like it does on every planet it exists on.   However, unlike most other worlds, magic on the continent was both abundant and focused on the far side of the continent, and built up to tremendous levels in the deep oceans.  The creatures that exist there can barely be described as living things.  So far lost to the influences of magic, many barely even exist on the material plane.   
One such creature, according to elven legends, which has given itself the name of Tzura Tbi Ywnrell, He Who Builds Above, delights in the manipulation of species.   The legend goes that a strange piece of metal fell into the deep ocean from the skies above, from it and a nearby creature of the deep, Tzura crafted the very first chromatic dragon.  Tzura, seeing his creation shine with purity and benevolence, lashed out and attempted to destroy the creature.  But, the dragon was not helpless and fled the clutches of the monster in the deep.

The Dragon took the name Abzu, and soon found she had a great deal more in common with the small folk who resided out of the water then the monsters within. Abzu spent years traveling, but found the elves of the continent to be quite friendly to them and eventually established her residence at Goldhaven, the capitol of Eastern Kingdom of the Elves.  To this day, a significant number of elven cities are home to metalic dragons, some extremely ancient.

Abzu is known as the mother of metalic dragons.  Her creator, Tzura Tbi Ywnrell, has also been credited with creating the Naga, chromatic dragons(specifically to hunt down it's metalic dragon mistake), as well as countless aboninations.
