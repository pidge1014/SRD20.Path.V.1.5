The city of Darktown was originally established by a group of religious refugees, escaping persecution from the nearby city of Ulztown.  The founders of the city followed a newly risen god of organization, Klems, and their list of issues with the orcish run city was substantial.

Primarily organized in octagonal buildings with small square buildings or parks to fill the empty space between, because hexigonal buildings have a slightly more efficient surface area to volume ratio then a square, without wasting outside city space like a circle would.

While every town has a volunteer fire brigade, the administrators of Darktown thought it unefficient to have separate groups managing the post, performing guard duty, repairing the infrastructure, and putting out the fires.  Certainly one person can accomplish those simple tasks.   In addition, the administrators also agreed it was unnecessary for separate equipment to be needed.   Thus were born the ladder wielding civil servants of Darktown known as a fire brigadier.

At the time of their creation, the town had a population of 600 and the firebrigadiers were not specialized.  The town is now 23,000+ residents large, and the organization is large enough to be slightly more specializated than before, although they do all still carry ladders.

**Battle Ladder:**  When wielding a battle ladder you are treated as having the two weapon fighting feat.

**Trapping Strike:**  When attacking an enemy from a higher altitude, you may choose to attempt to cause the ladder to trap your foe rather than strike them.  When your attack hits, you may chose to not deal damage and instead attempt a grapple combat maneuver.  The DC to break this grapple is equal to your CMD if you are holding the ladder.  If you release the ladder, the opponent is still restrained, but can free themselves with a standard action on their turn.

**Jab:**  You have learned to strike from a greater distance by not swinging your ladder weapon.  When making an attack with a ladder, you may choose to Jab rather than make a normal attack,  if you do so, your reach increases by 5ft, but you may not combine this with a trip maneuver or a trapping strike.

In addition, you are treated as having the improved two weapon fighting feat when wielding a battle ladder.

**Acrobatic Climb**:  As a swift action, you may set your ladder vertically and climb to the top.  While balancing on your ladder, you may act as though you were in the square above yours and may choose to treat your hands as empty.   If you end your turn balancing on top of your ladder, make an acrobatics check, DC 20, to stay there.  Failure results in falling to the floor prone.

You may make an attack with your ladder while standing on it, but doing causes you to land on the ground holding your ladder after the attack is made.

**Extender:**  As a senior member of the defense force, you have been granted an engineering marvel, an extending ladder.   As a move action, your 4 foot ladder can be extended into an 7.5 foot ladder.

`	`While using it as a 4 foot ladder, it is much heavier than your prior ladder, and therefor uses a damage dice one size higher than normal.

`	`While using the extended version, the weapon's base reach becomes 10ft, and acrobatic climb allows you to act as though you were up to 10 feet above you.  It is also possible to preform a trapping strike with reach, likely preventing your opponent from being in reach to attack back.

In addition, you are treated as having the greater two weapon fighting feat while using a battle ladder.

**Masonry:**  As your years of service in the guard have added up, so has your experience repairing and maintaining the town walls.  So much so that you have become adept at spotting weakness in stone walls, natural or otherwise.

`	`While making a full attack next to a natural or artificial stone wall, you may choose to help break loose a few stones with each strike.  Doing so incurs a -2 penalty to the attack roll, but causes an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage on hit.
