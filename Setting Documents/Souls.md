***Age***
Reincarnation is not especially common these days. As such, new born souls are the most common in the world. Even a soul that has been reincarnated a dozen times can largely be considered a new born.
* **New Born Soul**
 *Perpetual Wonder* - You go through live in amazement of all you see, often in wonder at how you are the only one that seems mezmorized by the great sights of the world. When exploring somewhere new, you are immune to fear.  If perpetual wonder is taken twice, when exploring somewhere new, once per round, you may roll twice and take the higher result on any roll.  Taking perpetual wonder additional times increases the number of times per round this may be done.
 *Unexpected Prodigy* - Req Intelligence 14 (+2 per rank) - You have learned to excel far past your peers at a particular skill.  Select one skill, you may add your class level to any rolls using that skill.  This can be selected more then once, but a different skill must be selected.
 *Curious Nature* - Your infinite desire to learn has resulted in you testing your weaknessess as often your strengths.   Increase your lowest ability score by 1.  In addition, you may gain one general feat for which you qualify.
* **Old Soul** 
 *Hardened Will* - Req Wisdom 12 (+2 per rank) - Over the years, your self idenity has hardened. Once per day, per rank, you may reroll a failed will save.
 *Familiar Knowledge* - Every so often when you learn something new, it comes to you naturally. You gain one feat which has a prerequisite feat that you possess. 
* **Ancient Soul** Few souls in the world ever reach the age of ancient, and the vast majority of them only do so through the efforts of powerful families who have kept their founding members souls re-incarnated within the family.
 *Family Scion* - Req Charisma 12 (+2 per rank) - You are the uncounted reincarnation of a very poweful family or organization.  As such, you carry yourself with an esteemed dignity and greater sense of purpose.  Your charisma increases by 1.  In addition, you may use your charisma modifier in place of your dexterity for reflex saves, ac, initiative, or a single skill.  Any time you select family scion, you may select an additional trait to use charisma instead of dex, but do not gain additional charisma.
 *Deep Well* - All magic requires your inner will to shape and manifest itself. Your well of inner will is, however, ancient.  When casting a spell using wisdom as the primary casting stat, you reduce the effect of any spell immunities or resistance the target has.  Immunity goes to SR equal to CR times 1.5,  CR of any kind is reduced by 5.  If this is taken multiple times the effect is applied again (so a target immune to your spell instead just has SR equal to the creatures CR, multiplied by 1.5, minus 5.
