***Age***  
Reincarnation is not especially common these days. As such, new born souls are the most common in the world. Even a soul that has been reincarnated a dozen times can largely be considered a new born.  
* **New Born Soul**  
  * *Perpetual Wonder* - You go through live in amazement of all you see, often in wonder at how you are the only one that seems mezmorized by the great sights of the world. When exploring somewhere new, you are immune to fear.  If perpetual wonder is taken twice, when exploring somewhere new, once per round, you may roll twice and take the higher result on any roll.  Taking perpetual wonder additional times increases the number of times per round this may be done.  
  * *Unexpected Prodigy* - Req Intelligence 14 (+2 per rank) - You have learned to excel far past your peers at a particular skill.  Select one skill, you may add your class level to any rolls using that skill.  This can be selected more then once, but a different skill must be selected.  
  * *Curious Nature* - Your infinite desire to learn has resulted in you testing your weaknessess as often your strengths.   Increase your lowest ability score by 1.  In addition, you may gain one general feat for which you qualify.

  * *Familiar Knowledge* - Every so often when you learn something new, it comes to you naturally. You gain one feat which has a prerequisite feat that you possess.  

* **Ancient Soul** Few souls in the world ever reach the age of ancient, and the vast majority of them only do so through the efforts of powerful families who have kept their founding members souls re-incarnated within the family.  
  * *Family Scion* - Req Charisma 12 (+2 per rank) - You are the uncounted reincarnation of a very poweful family or organization.  As such, you carry yourself with an esteemed dignity and greater sense of purpose.  Your charisma increases by 1.  In addition, you may use your charisma modifier in place of your dexterity for reflex saves, ac, initiative, or a single skill.  Any time you select family scion, you may select an additional trait to use charisma instead of dex, but do not gain additional charisma.  
  * *Deep Well* - All magic requires your inner will to shape and manifest itself. Your well of inner will is, however, ancient.  When casting a spell using wisdom as the primary casting stat, you reduce the effect of any spell immunities or resistance the target has.  Immunity goes to SR equal to CR times 1.5,  SR of any kind is reduced by 5.  If this is taken multiple times the effect is applied again (so a target immune to your spell instead just has SR equal to the creatures CR, multiplied by 1.5, minus 5.

Through this connection, you have learned to channel the natural magic of the world.  You may select one spell from the druid or shaman spell lists with a spell level equal to or less than half your character level (round up).  You may cast this spell a number of times per day equal to half your charisma modifier.  If you select this a second time, you pick a different spell.  It does not share the same pool of uses per day.

     *Saving Sheild* : As an immidiate action, you may add your shield bonus + 2 to an adjacent ally's AC.  
     *Step Up* : If a foe makes a 5 ft step away from you, you may move 5ft to follow them as a free action.   
     *Apes Cleave* : If an attack you make hits a foe, you may attack an adjacent target at the same attack bonus.  If you do this, you take a -2 penalty to your AC for one round and provoke an attack of opportunity.  This is treated as cleave for the purposes of feats.  
  * *Tanuki Decendent*  These small charismatic shapechanging humanoids are often only revealed when one of their children is revealed to have unexpected ancestory. You have retained their great love of drink, and along with it, the ability to accomplish great things.  The first time you take this trait, select one of the following spells: Divine Favor, False Life, Haste, Rage.  When you drink a full glass of sake (or equivalent), you gain the effects of that spell with a caster level equal to your hit dice.
