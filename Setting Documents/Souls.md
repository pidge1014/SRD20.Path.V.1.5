***Age***  
Reincarnation is not especially common these days. As such, new born souls are the most common in the world. Even a soul that has been reincarnated a dozen times can largely be considered a new born.  
* **New Born Soul**  
  * *Perpetual Wonder* - You go through live in amazement of all you see, often in wonder at how you are the only one that seems mezmorized by the great sights of the world. When exploring somewhere new, you are immune to fear.  If perpetual wonder is taken twice, when exploring somewhere new, once per round, you may roll twice and take the higher result on any roll.  Taking perpetual wonder additional times increases the number of times per round this may be done.  
  * *Unexpected Prodigy* - Req Intelligence 14 (+2 per rank) - You have learned to excel far past your peers at a particular skill.  Select one skill, you may add your class level to any rolls using that skill.  This can be selected more then once, but a different skill must be selected.  
  * *Curious Nature* - Your infinite desire to learn has resulted in you testing your weaknessess as often your strengths.   Increase your lowest ability score by 1.  In addition, you may gain one general feat for which you qualify.  
* **Old Soul**  
  * *Hardened Will* - Req Wisdom 12 (+2 per rank) - Over the years, your self idenity has hardened. Once per day, per rank, you may reroll a failed will save.  
  * *Familiar Knowledge* - Every so often when you learn something new, it comes to you naturally. You gain one feat which has a prerequisite feat that you possess.  
* **Ancient Soul** Few souls in the world ever reach the age of ancient, and the vast majority of them only do so through the efforts of powerful families who have kept their founding members souls re-incarnated within the family.  
  * *Family Scion* - Req Charisma 12 (+2 per rank) - You are the uncounted reincarnation of a very poweful family or organization.  As such, you carry yourself with an esteemed dignity and greater sense of purpose.  Your charisma increases by 1.  In addition, you may use your charisma modifier in place of your dexterity for reflex saves, ac, initiative, or a single skill.  Any time you select family scion, you may select an additional trait to use charisma instead of dex, but do not gain additional charisma.  
  * *Deep Well* - All magic requires your inner will to shape and manifest itself. Your well of inner will is, however, ancient.  When casting a spell using wisdom as the primary casting stat, you reduce the effect of any spell immunities or resistance the target has.  Immunity goes to SR equal to CR times 1.5,  SR of any kind is reduced by 5.  If this is taken multiple times the effect is applied again (so a target immune to your spell instead just has SR equal to the creatures CR, multiplied by 1.5, minus 5.  

***Magic***  
* **Feybound Soul**  
  * *Bonded Creature* - A specific fey creature has taken a great interest in you and you have formed a strong bond.  Each time you select this, you gain a supernatural or extraordinary ability from the creature you have bonded with. If you choose, you may instead select a special quality, sense, feat, language,or speed.  In addition, embracing this connection shapes who you are.  Your alignment shifts one step towards the alignment of your bonded creature, until they match.  You first shift along Lawful<->Chaotic axis, and then along Good<->Evil.   
  * *Love of the Wild* - You are most at home in nature and the wild.  Any time you are in the wild and out of sight of any buildings, you gain a +1 to all rolls, AC, and saves.  
  * *Land Bound* - You have always been fond of the subtle strength the natural world holds and have bound yourself to a portion of it. Through this connection, you have learned to channel the natural magic of the world.  You may select one spell from the druid or shaman spell lists with a spell level equal to or less than half your character level (round up).  You may cast this spell a number of times per day equal to half your charisma modifier.  If you select this a second time, you pick a different spell.  It does not share the same pool of uses per day.  
* **Timebound Soul**   Your soul has been bound to the eternal drum of time.  Attuning to the endless drum of time conforms your soul to uniformity.  Each time you take a timebound trait, your alignment shifts one step towards Lawful Neutral.  You first shift along Lawful<->Chaotic axis, and then along Good<->Evil.  
  * *Natural Rhythm* - You have learned the natural rhythm of the world, and can seize the correct moment in time better then most.  Each day, you must spend 20 minutes in meditation, attuning to the rhythm of the universe. Once completed, you are treated as if you are under the effects of Moment of Prescience for the next 24 hours, with a caster level equal to your character level.  If natural rhythm is taken an additional time, you gain an additional use of moment of prescience before it expires.  
  * *Temporal Celerity* - Whenever you roll initiative, you may roll twice and take the higher result. In addition, you always act in a surprise round, although if you did not notice you act last in the surprise round, regardless of your initiative roll.  Each time you take this, you add an additional dice to your initiative roll.  
  * *Natural Foresight* - Once per day, you may cast contingency as a spell like ability. If you have the ability to cast contingency from another source, you may cast it in addition to using your natural foresight and it may function separately.
