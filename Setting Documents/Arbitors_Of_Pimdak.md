The Ancient platues that Pimdak was built on have always possessed a quality that nullifies magic in the area.   The magic is not dispelled, but simply and thouroughly, supressed.  Magical creatures, items, spells, and talents people didnt realize came from the arcane powers of the world, all become mundane while on the great steppes.  
To this day, the mundane nature of life in Pimdak serves as a great equalizer between the magical powers of the world.

The Arbitors of Pimdak consists of representatives of each of the major clans that populate the City of Pimdak.  They serve as a council that resolves any dispute that occurs within the city.   The decisions are ratified with a simple majority vote and enforcement is left up to the clans.   Pimdak has no official laws, simply the will of the arbitors and the informal social ethics that guide there decisions.

As one might guess, this creates a system where if you are not a member of one of the 15 major clans in the city, you are living as a second class citizen in a lawless city.  It is especially unwise to visit alone if you are unfamiliar with the customs of the city, especially considering these proceedings are exclusively conducted in an ancient varient of the orcish language.

The arbitors themselves are often not the leader of the clans, as they have far more important things to do then manage the daily complaints of a city.

The strongest of the Clan's is known in common as "The Broken Axe", or "Bajrak Lagurz Sapat".  Their members run a school that teaches a local and brutal fighting techniques.  Anyone worthy, as judged by the school's teachers, is allowed to train with them.

The current list of Arbitors and their clans are as follows:


Lagurz Sapat      (Broken Axe Clan)

Dery Lightfoot    - Lightfoot Clan(Draut Fra) The only halfling clan in Pimdak, lightfoot clan has done well for themselves all things considered.  The halflings are by far the most likely group to help out a stranger, but will not risk their status in the city for an outsider.

Fark Goth         (The Masters of the Forge)
