The city of Last Watch is more of a small fortress on the edge of civilization.  To most of the world, Last Watch is home to a great and selfless order guarding an invaluable outpost along the border of the scar. But in truth, Last Watch holds a great and dark secret. 

600 years ago, the city mistakenly made a pact with a powerful entity that was later to be revealed as an archdevil. The city's coven's leader, betrayed the city, and created a permanent portal within a small local monastery on the side of Evergreen Mountain. The devils that spewed forth were destroyed, but the portal could not be unmade without finding its creator who fled into the Scar, or destroying the Archdevil. The order of monks, at first with help from the witches, took the responsibility of guarding this portal from anything that comes from it, while the witches took the responsibility of closing it for good.

The city of Last Watch now entirely encompasses the monastery, but they have kept their original name. Unlike most monasteries, the monks of Evergreen spend their days perfecting the art of teaching their techniques they have developed over the centuries for killing devils and welcome students in exchange for service.

The monastery, as its existence is secret, does not directly interact with potential students. They only accept recommendations from the local coven to be tested for admission.

**Aversion to evil:**  You have taken an oath against all evil creatures of the outer realms.  You are not able to summon any evil outsiders and consider such actions inherently evil, even when done by arcane casters.  Traveling with or summoning a devil will result in immediate expulsion from the order.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:**  The monk's teach their students their techniques exclusively with fauchards and light armor.  At level 1, gain proficiency with light armor and all pole-arms.

**Shrewd Attacks:** When using a pole-arm, you may use your wisdom modifier in place of your strength for attack rolls

**Thoughtful positioning:** Add Wisdom Modifier to AC when wearing light or no armor.

**Anticipate Momentum**: A number of times per day equal to your Dexterity modifier, when dealing damage, you may use your enemies strength modifier instead of your own.

**Devil Slayer:**  When wielding a pole-arm, you ignore any immunity to critical hits an evil outsider may posses.   You are also immune to mind effecting spells, and receive a +5 bonus to any save that bypasses this immunity.
