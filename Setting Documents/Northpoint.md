To the far north of Flintfall's Splinter rests the isle of Northpoint.  The majority of this small land mass is covered in mountains.  The city has expanded to the point where its residents are now living in houses hanging from the side of the mountains by ropes.  The island has almost no natural resources, with one exception.  A large contigent of drakes calls the upper peaks of the mountains home and the ancient natives of this island long ago learned how to tame them.

The Drake Masters of the continent, unlike many others that employ creatures, do not raise them and tame them through traditional methods.  The Drake Masters instead rely on ancient magical techniques that bind the drake to their owner.  The bindings become inherit to the drake and may not be broken or dispelled once formed without harming the drake. However, over the years, the drake masters have learned to improve the already mighty drakes using these rituals.

If an animal companion class feature is selected as an ingrained class you may increase your class level in a different feature.

**Magical Infusion(ex) :** At 5th level, your drake gains one point of eidelon evolution for every 5HD it possesses.
