Silversun, like most old elven cities, is home to a flight of dragons.  In this case, as expected, a flight of silver dragons calls the hills beside the city and the nearby islands home.  Unlike many of the others, however, there is no ancient dragon ruling the city, and the lesser wurms here are far closer to loyal citizens then rulers.

Also unlike many of the other elves, the armies of Silversun wear dragon scale armor gifted by their dragon allies that share the city.  Most dragons avoid this, so the elves do not share weaknesses with them, but the lack of other armor options in the area has resulted in this being the best defensive option for the location elves.

Despite no longer having an ancient dragon residing here, Silversun is amoung the oldest city in Splintfall.

The Sigbathian Circus was a traveling circus that roamed the eastern coast of the continent.  When the Scar formed, they found themselves trapped in the elven lands.  Not able to return north, the circus made a permanent home outside Silversun and remain there today.

Their acrobat act has developed into their star attraction, as their artists don't just swing and flip, but have incorporated martial displays as part of their acts.  With slow fall enchantments, there is little actual danger, but the displays are impressive none the less.

The acrobats are always looking for new recruits.  All of the weapon displays were techniques brought into the school by outsiders, and the Sigbathian's are always happy to trade fighting style secrets.

**Quick Step Up:**  You may stand up from prone as a free action.  
**Slow Fall:**  You ignore the first 40 feet of falling damage.  
**Evasion:**  You gain evasion.  If you already have evasion, you gain improved evasion.  
**Defensive Roll:** An acrobat can avoid a potentially lethal blow.  Once per day, when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points from damage, an acrobat can attempt to roll with the blow with a reflex save.  The DC of the save is the amount of damage greater than the amount that would bring you to 0 hit points.  If the save succeeds, then you negate the damage that brings you below 0 hit points.  
**Cartwheels:**  As a special full round action, you may incorporate acrobatics with your attacks.  You may either make a charge attack, or a skirmish attack.   Roll an acrobatics skill check at a DC of 20
If you made a charge attack, you charge as normal.  If you succeeded on your acrobatics roll, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you deal any sneak attack damage you have at the end of your charge.  
If you make a skirmish attack, you may move up to your speed, making a ranged attack at any point.  If you succeeded on the acrobatics roll, you do not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the attack is treated as an attack action your attack is treated as if it was under the effects of Vital strike.  If you have vital strike, you may increase the number of times you roll your weapons dice by one.
