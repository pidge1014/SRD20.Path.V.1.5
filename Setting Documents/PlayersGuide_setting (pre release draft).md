# The Continent: Players Guide

## Pathfinder 1.5e
**What is available?**  At this point, the base classes present represent a framework for classes, but not every option.  Everything from Pathfinder 1e is technically available in some form, but may require some conversion to stay inline with the intended goals of 1.5.
* **Action economy** At high levels especially, a wizard can have a 10-15 minute turn and if the enemy is lacking similiar support, wins.  One of the system goals is to bring action economy in line accross the classes.  The standard for action economy in this system is a wizard with a familiar, casting two spells a round with a rod of familiar spell and their standard action.  At high levels, the action economy standard is time stop.  At extreme levels, it is an empowered maximized time stop with quickened spells.  Not all classes quite reach this many actions, and some can surpass it, but the intent is for all classes to gain agency as they level.
* **Limited optimization** Pathfinder and 3.5 suffer from similiar problems, there are a large number of builds that work early on and in mid game, but do not effectively compete at high level.  Moreover, there is a significant convergence of options for classes and builds and nearly all high level characters will have the same set of predictable feats.  In 1.5, this is attempted to be solved with ingrained class features, defining major class features and minor class features, and class features that may enable otherwise useless feats.  Ingraining a class feature enables the most critical aspects of your class to scale with you.  A major class feature is defined as a unique feature that can not be replicated with a minutes per level spell, designed to scale with the class (IE, a class feature you want to ingrain).  Each class should have 4-5 major class features, to make selecting ingrained features a real choice.
* **Lack of class identity** While the base game of pathfinder 1e did not suffer from this as much, by the end, when all archetypes were considered, classes had little identity. Major class features in 1.5e are going to be treated as sacred to the class that has them(  For example, a druids level 4 wildshape is really just beast form, a wizard spell.  This makes it a minor class feature and therefor no reason to keep it unique to druids.  Can certainly make a shapeshifting prestige class or archetype for a different class.  The druid capstone; however, makes this ability function like nothing else in the game, which is a major class feature and will not be found.

## Classes summary in the setting
* **Fighter** :Fighters are the ultimate martial combatants.  They are the masters of using weapons.  The cost of this is mobility, fighters are the only class do not have any increased action economy and will need help to stay in full attack range.  When there, enemies should disapear shortly.
* **Bard** : Versatile to the extreme. Bards can do a little bit of everything, including having access to other classes spell lists, but don't really do anything the best.  Masterpieces have been rewritten and are actually useful.
* **Druid** : The Druid's have regained their shapeshifting prowess. Their capstone power provides them with 3.5 style true polymorph as their wild shape.  Their spell list is still the same, and they have the largest list of animal companion options. Druids are arcane spell casters, as they predate the existence of gods. (Fey magic is basically primal magic, but technically arcane)  This has no effect on their spellcasting, as long as their armor is natural.
* **Ranger** : The ranger is a versatile combatant, behind the fighter in raw damage, but potent none the less.  But, when paired with their loyal companion, they are a dangerous addition to any party.
* **Magus** : Blending magic and attacks, the magus can compete with any class in raw damage, depending on what spells they decide to cast on their turn.  Magus is largely unchanged in terms of base mechanics, but will now scale their actions better.
* **Scout** : When an army, or group of any size, needs to send someone to take a look, that person is usually a scout.  Scouts are masters of movement, and typically possess the skills needed to infiltrate whatever is nessesary.  This is the closest thing to a rogue that has been defined thus far.
* **Cleric** : If you are willing to follow a church's strick and often strange dogma, there can be great power found.  Clerics are restricted in following their god's rules, and will lose some powers for even small deviations. Assuming they are in their god's good graces, they can wade into battle with martial prowess, focus on spell casting, or become the ultimate support character.(warpriest was merged into cleric, and they have a full BAB option)
* **Faithless** : Faithless rely on their mental accuity to cast spells, and survive them.  They are the undisputed kings of action economy, but are far more battlefield controller than the type of magical threat brought by a wizard or witch.  Faithless are technically the monks of the setting, but gave up most of their monestic traditions long ago.  (there are true monks in this world, but monastic vows and their extremely disciplined lifestyles rarely coexist with adventuring) 
* **Wizard** : A Wizard is a powerful student of the natural fonts of magic.  Which one they specialize in will often shape them in strange ways. 
* **Witch** : Where Wizards specialize in understanding magic intellictually, witches work to understand magic emotionally.  It is often said a witch could bend a rock to her will.

# The Gods

On the very first day an intelligent creature stirred on the Continent, there were no gods in the universe.  The raw powers of the universe existed, but remained uncontrolled and unfocused.  With the help of magic, creatures evolved into the wild and unexplainable variety of life that is found today.

It was not until Benjamin the Conqueror died that the world knew their first god.  Benjamin was far from the most powerful individual to be alive or have lived, nor was he the most revered living being. But, at the moment of his death, a blindingly bright light erupted upwards and ascended on the faith of his citizens and became the first god of the High Pantheon, and created the first of the outer planes, now knows as the Upper Outer Planes.

Many other gods followed over the years, and their stories have played major roles in shaping both the world and the Outer Planes they reside in. Hundreds of planes came into form, some mischeveous, but none were truly evil. But, perhaps no other god, including Benjamin, shaped the world like the ascendance of Yrill.

1 in 10,000 children born are found to be fundamentally tied to one of the sources of magic.  Yrill was born bound to all three.  This would not nessessarily have been a curse, if not for the influence of a young fae, a hobkins named Tifzi.  Yrill gathered a massive following as he built his empire, but many theologians and clerics theorized at the time that no one as cruel and malicious as him would ever draw worship in a comparable way to a benevolent ruler.  But, on the day of his death, when the power of divine faith began to manifest him into a god and his followers proved the priesthoods of the world wrong, the gods of the Upper Pantheon stepped in to reward their faithful by blocking his ascent.  

While they succeeded in keeping Yrill from the realms of the Upper Pantheon, the will of the faithful could not be denied.   A strange dark energy was born, its existence a mockery of creation itself, and it ripped through the earth twisting everything it touched.  The Scar, as it is commonly known, consumed all of Yrill's massive kingdom, his faithful servants transformed into terrible creatures and the faithless turned to shadows.  The destruction rippled accross the continent and its presence stains the world to this day.

The hellish lower outer planes of the Low Pantheon were also born that day.  The twisted and dark realms that inhabit the Low Pantheon, and their residents, are powered by the antithesis of creation, commonly known as negative energy.  While they are technically alive, the living world and power of life is as toxic to them as the Scar is to mortals.


## The Continent

The Continent is large, and spans over 50,000 miles across at its longest point.  Before the Scar, a great wizard could teleport from one end to the other without issue, and the world was a very different place then it has become today.

When the Scar formed, it uncoiled in all directions.  Entire cities were enveloped and their inhabitants destroyed, if they were lucky. As devastating as this was, learning that this new horror functions in contrast to magic as they knew it, was worse.

While teleportation is taken for granted as instant, the caster is in fact traveling through one of the non-physical planes.  It's typically the astral plane, but can often be the ethereal, and certain traditions have learned to tap into shadow and timeless planes.  These facts were not well known before the Scar, because all of these planes were continious and the spells simply worked. But in the Scar, many of these planes do not exist in the same way.

Any time a magic user casts a long range teleport to an unknown location, there is always a small chance they will suffer a failure along the way.  Most magic users of the world have made work arounds to this problem using fixed teleportation circles to reliable destinations, and sharing guides that note the known stretches of the scar. Druids, for example, have created groves of blueleaf trees in most major cities to assist in travel.

There are entire civilizations that have been largely cut off from the world due to the scar forming around them. But thankfully to the world, there was one civilization that decided to call it home.  The City of Peace rests in the center of the Scar.  The warded roads to this city lead to the edges of the Scar and are always built strait, to ensure anyone using the roads to safely teleport.  There is however, one catch.  The powerful magic used to ward the stone pathway from the Scar also prevents the malicious of heart from using them.  The magic doesn't care if you are justified in your hatred or not, it will turn you away all the same.

Over the many years, the City of Peace has continued to built roads, both literal and with diplomacy, to each of these cut off civilizations.  This has resulted in the City of Peace being one of the few places in the continent that actually has contact with the entire continent and is a well known travel hub.  The City itself has a much more powerful version of the protective ward on it, as it was cast by the goddess of peace before she ascended.

## Flintfall's Splinter

Flintfall's Splinter, is perhaps the most secluded of all of these lands to be cut off from the continent by the Scar and will be home to the start of the campaign.  

Lying in the South Eastern part of the continent, the Scar stretches deep into the sea at its boarders and nearly envelopes the small peninsula.  But buried here were some of the continents great treasures.

In the Islands to the east, resides one of the oldest Elf civilizations in the continent.  While they do not possess the greatest of wizards, they may possess the most spiritual.  In the City of Silversun, the seers track the celestial movements and have prophetic visions during these rituals, which they record on a sacred wall.  The most note worthy days on their wall were the days of the births of Yrill and Ushuk, along with the cities these children were born in.  They have marked several other days each with a city, but what meaning those dates held are not commonly known.  The most recent date noted on the wall was for the birth of a child in the isles to the South.

The Flintfall Mountains housed a mighty empire of dwarves, which was all but destroyed when the scar formed.  The dwarves of Mount Herbert live in the only surviving city of the old Empire.  Centeries ago, the clan chief of Mount Herbert led an expedition down the great underground highway into the scarred lands to find the fate of their fellow Flintfall Dwarves.  Less then half the expedition returned and the highway was destroyed behind them. The dwarves of Mount Herbert do not discuss what they found and the fate of their brethren.
(this will be expaned with the locations and factions)

## Dragons, Naga, and the early 'gods' of the world

Life evolved on the continent much like it does on every planet it exists on.   However, unlike most other worlds, magic on the continent was both abundant and focused on the far side of the continent, and built up to tremendous levels in the deep oceans.  The creatures that exist there can barely be described as living things.  So far lost to the influences of magic, many barely even exist on the material plane.   
One such creature, according to elven legends, which has given itself the name of Tzura Tbi Ywnrell, He Who Builds Above, delights in the manipulation of species.   The legend goes that a strange piece of metal fell into the deep ocean from the skies above, from it and a nearby creature of the deep, Tzura crafted the very first chromatic dragon.  Tzura, seeing his creation shine with purity and benevolence, lashed out and attempted to destroy the creature.  But, the dragon was not helpless and fled the clutches of the monster in the deep.

The Dragon took the name Abzu, and soon found she had a great deal more in common with the small folk who resided out of the water then the monsters within. Abzu spent years traveling, but found the elves of the continent to be quite friendly to them and eventually established her residence at Goldhaven, the capitol of Eastern Kingdom of the Elves.  To this day, a significant number of elven cities are home to chromatic dragons

Abzu is known as the mother of metalic dragons.  Her creator, Tzura Tbi Ywnrell, has also been credited with creating the Naga, chromatic dragons(specifically to hunt down it's metalic dragon mistake), as well as countless aboninations.

## Character Rules

Characters will use a 25 point buy for ability scores, start at level 4, with 10,500 gold in wealth.  There are no rules for how this money is spent, nor are there limits for who your character can be.
The continient is 50,000 miles accross, and while Flintfall's Splinter is small, the City of Peace connects it to the world.  There is no reason the gunslinging dwarven airship captain and his crew can't find themselves there, even if there is no local equivalent.  Any archetype or class from pathfinder 1.e should be considered available.

Note: There are P1e classes that do not have major class features as I have defined them. (excluding capstones: monks, slayers, and rogues have 0 unique and scalable class features)  The closest is sneak attack, but holy crap is that everywhere in 1e.

Unchained and Mythic is not allowed.  Mythic's solution to action economy is "everyone can pounce", which was lazy and kind of boring, IMO.  I have balance concerns with Unchained.

While everything pathfinder is technically still available for adaption, something special to make these base classes scale in a unique and interesting way will need to be added or adapted.

Note: A Minor Class Feature is simply something that is mainly RP or out of combat, granted by spells or feats, or commonly available to other classes.  In 1.5e, a wizard can not simply obsolete another characters class features with a permanent spell.
