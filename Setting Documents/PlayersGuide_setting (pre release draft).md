# The Continent: Players Guide


## The Gods


On the very first day an intelligent creature walked on The Continent, there were no gods in the universe.  The raw powers of the universe existed, but remained uncontrolled and unfocused.  With the help of magic, creatures evolved into the wild and unexplainable variety of life that is found today.

It was not until Benjamin the Conqueror died that the world knew their first god.  Benjamin was far from the most powerful individual to be alive or have lived, nor was he the most revered living being. But, at the moment of his death, a blindingly bright light erupted upwards and ascended on the faith of his citizens and became the first god of the High Pantheon, and created the first of the outer planes, now knows as the Upper Outer Planes.

Many other gods followed over the years, and their stories have played major roles in shaping both the world and the Outer Planes they reside in. Hundreds of planes came into form, some mischeveous, but none were truly evil. But, perhaps no other god, including Benjamin, shaped the world like the ascendance of Yrill.

1 in 10,000 children born are found to be fundamentally tied to one of the sources of magic.  Yrill was born bound to all three.  This would not nessessarily have been a curse, if not for the influence of a young fae, a hobkins named Tifzi.  Yrill gathered a massive following as he built his empire, but many theologians and clerics theorized at the time that no one as cruel and malicious as him would ever draw worship in a comparable way to a benevolent ruler.  But, on the day of his death, when the power of divine faith began to manifest him into a god and his followers proved the priesthoods of the world wrong, the gods of the Upper Pantheon stepped in to reward their faithful by blocking his ascent.  

While they succeeded in keeping Yrill from the realms of the Upper Pantheon, the will of the faithful could not be denied.   A strange dark energy was born, its existence a mockery of creation itself, and it ripped through the earth twisting everything it touched.  The scar consumed all of Yrill's massive kingdom, his faithful servants transformed into terrible creatures and the faithless turned to shadows.  The tear rippled accross the continent and its presence stains the world to this day.

The hellish lower outer planes of the Low Pantheon were also born that day.  The twisted and dark realms that inhabit the Low Pantheon, and their residents, are powered by the antithesis of creation, commonly known as negative energy.  While they are technically alive, the living world and power of life is as toxic to them as the Scar is to mortals.


## The Continent

The Continent spans over 50,000 miles across, at its longest point, and over 22,000 miles, at its longest, straight north to south.  Before the Scar, a great wizard could teleport from one end to the other without issue, and the world was a very different place then it has become today.

When the Scar formed, it uncoiled in all directions.  Entire cities were enveloped and their inhabitants destroyed, if they were lucky.  It is said, by those who care to measure such things, that parts of the Scar reach the northern, eastern, and southern shores of the continent.  As devastating as this was, learning that this new horror functions in contrast to magic as they knew it, was worse.

While teleportation is taken for granted as instant, the caster is in fact traveling through one of the non-physical planes.  It's typically the astral plane, but can often be the ethereal, and certain traditions have learned to tap into shadow and timeless planes.  These facts were not well known before the Scar, because the spells simply worked, and in the Scar, many of these planes do not consistently exist.  So, when all teleportation spells began failing randomly at some point over the bits of Scar, travel came to a halt.

Any time a magic user casts a long range teleport to an unknown location, there is always a small chance they will suffer a failure along the way.  Most magic users of the world have made work arounds to this problem using fixed teleportation circles to reliable destinations, and sharing guides that note the known stretches of the scar, but going around the scar can still take an extra few spells and parts of the scar has been known to move.

There are entire civilizations that have been largely cut off from the world due to the scar forming around them. But thankfully to the world, there was one that decided to call it home.  The City of Peace rests in the center of the Scar.  The warded roads to this city lead to the edges of the scar and are always built strait, to ensure anyone using the roads to safely teleport will have protection the entire way.  There is however, one catch.  The powerful magic used to ward the stone pathway from the Scar also prevents the malicious of heart from using them.  The magic doesn't care if you are justified in your hatred or not, it will turn you away all the same.

Over the many years, the City of Peace has continued to built roads, both literal and with diplomacy, to each of these cut off civilizations.  This has resulted in the City of Peace being one of the few places in the continent that actually has contact with the entire continent and is a well known travel hub.  The City itself has a much more powerful version of the protective ward on it, as it was cast by the goddess of peace before she ascended.

Flintfall's Splinter, is perhaps the most secluded of all of these lands to be cut off from the continent by the Scar.  Lying in the South Eastern part of the continent, Flintfall's splinter is one of the closest pieces of land to the formation of the Scar, to survive at least.  The Scar that surrounds it stretches deep into the sea and nearly envelopes the small peninsula.  But buried here were some of the continents great treasures.

In the Islands to the east, resides one of the oldest Elf civilizations in the continent.  While they do not possess the greatest of wizards, they may possess the most spiritual.  In the City of Silversun, the seers track the celestial movements and have prophetic visions during these rituals.  The most note worthy days on their wall were the days of the births of Yrill and Ushuk, as well as the cities these children were born in.  They have marked several days each with a city, but what meaning those dates held are not commonly known.  The most recent date noted on the wall was for the birth of a child .

The Flintfall Mountains housed a mighty empire of dwarves.  If would sadden the dwarves of Mount Herbert, to know of the fate of the rest of the Flintfall dwarves as most of the mountain range has been enveloped by the Scar.  There are rumors of nasty dwarf like creatures roaming the dark cursed dwarven halls under the Scar, but few are fool hardy enough to venture into that accursed place to find out.

**Berrydew Valley, and South of the Flintfall Mountains**

To the majority of the world, the Scar is simply something to avoid.  An inconvenience that messes with long distance teleportation, and little else.  This is because the majority of creatures native to the horrific wastes are also stuck there.  The energy of the area outside the scar is as harmful to them as the scar is to humanoids.

The plains south of the Flintfall Mountains have always been strange.   Huge stretches of land possess bizarre neutral aura's, a property that, in ancient times, was perfect for magic experimentation.   Modern day, however, it has become a battleground for those who wish to reside here, as the evil creatures of the scar, who have learned they can travel here unhindered.

The front line of this battle in the north was taken up by the Witches of the Last Watch Coven, who refused to concede their sacred land and have given up the normal duties of a coven.  Instead, devoting themselves purely to defending their cities from outside threats.   They have constructed a series of magically warded outposts, which are each manned by 2-3 witches at any given time.  Unlike most covens, there is an actual hierarchy in this organization and they are structured more like a military, with specialized roles, than any identifiable coven.  The population at Last Watch Coven is varied and still contains some remnants of the normal city it used to be.

The southern boarder is defended by the brave halflings of West Berrydew.  West Berrydew is not so much a city as it is a military colony of East Berrydew.  Full citizens of East Berrydew are all required to join the armed forces for two years upon reaching adulthood, and serve in a rotation in West Berrydew or the fortifications along the scar.  While the casualty rate the halflings suffer defending their lands is tremendous, they do their job well, and the greater population of East Berrydew is safe and prosperous.

South of West Berrydew exists a bay with a strange population of sea hag.  The ancient tale of the land is the naga spent generations trying to breed compliance into these creatures and it almost worked, but no one really knows.   These creatures are neither friendly nor outgoing, but consistently aid the halflings while fighting creatures from the scar along the shoreline.  In many cases, the hags have been observed engaging and destroying demons who ventured into their bay.

The local coven of witches in East Berrydew consistently work to improve this relationship, and while the sea hags accept the gifts given, no formal relationship has been established.

East Berrydew is one of the most prosperous and productive cities in Flintfall's splinter.  The city supports over 100k citizens, mostly halflings, sits on a shallow bay filled with fish, and is surrounded by prosperous farmlands.  The population is almost entirely retired soldiers who are gifted a house after their service, and because housing is plentiful and food is nearly limitless, the crime rate is impossibly low. There may not be a city on the continent where the people appreciate and celebrate a peaceful life as much as here.

If they survived their tour in the army to the west, a long and wonderful life awaits those born here
