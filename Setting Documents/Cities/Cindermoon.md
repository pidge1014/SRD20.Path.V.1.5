Cindermoon is a small city, primarily housed by individuals that love the untamed wilds of a jungle.  Nearly the entire extended island is untamed jungle.  That isn't to say it isnt populated, just that the residents have found a place in the wilds that works along side nature.  Taming the wild animals, or more often, training them slightly, is an extremely common practice. 

Of all the wild animals that have been tamed, perhaps none are more impressive than the wranglers of the western Cindermoon's mastery of the devil monkey.  

Devil Monkey's were first raised to assist the local halfings with collecting the annual fruit harvest.  At first, the halflings simply played off the monkey's natural behavior.  When threatened, they would throw what they had on hand.  If you are foolish enough to threaten one in a rock quarry, it will be a bad day for you; but, if you threaten one in a fruit tree, its a free harvest.

This natural behavior of using tools as weapons has allowed those who have these companions to teach them how to use more advanced crafted tools.  This is usually limited to thrown weapons as there is less to teach, but some have trained their devil monkey's to wield maces and other straight forward melee weapons.  While these monkey's are exceptional for an animal, they are still animals.

The markets of Cindermoon are flush with fruits from the forests that surround it, and it is both common and acceptable to find slightly smashed fruit sold.

**Monkey Wrangling (Ex):** A Monkey Wrangler may add devil monkey to the list of available animal companions. In addition, their levels in monkey wrangler stack with any that grant animal companions for the purposes of the animal's level.
If an animal companion class feature is selected as an ingrained class feature you may increase your class level in a different class feature instead.

**Advanced Training(Ex)**: At 3rd level, your animal companion may learn one proficiency that you have for every 10 hit dice it possesses. This may be any proficiency, such as a skill, a single weapon, or type of armor.  Your companion must still be capable of taking advantage of the proficiency to gain any benefit per gm discretion. 

**Shared Talent(ex) :** At 5th level, you may share one ingrained class feature with your animal companion. Your companion uses your class level, but otherwise uses its own statistics to determine the effects of the class feature, if they apply. Some features may have additional requirements an animal companion lacks, such as spell casting, or may have intelligence requirements and can not be shared.  Ultimately, the shared class feature is subject to GM approval.

A cohort may not benefit from this.
