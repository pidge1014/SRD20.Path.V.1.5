The town of Thistle Grove is broken into several neighborhoods.  The market, port and official builds are all along the northern end of the city in an area known as portside. The largest section is where the islands farms are located, in the plains to the south west, an area known as west valley.

While there is a local government manages most affairs, the island of Thistle Grove is home to a small coven of witches.  There presence has prevented any nefarious churches or creatures from gaining any sort of footing in the area.  Largely thanks to the quiet covens, Thistle Grove is one of the most boring islands on the continent.

Perhaps nowhere on the continent is the art of murder more openly practiced than in the sparring halls of the Westvalley School for Murder.  Originally an assassins guild, influence from some prominent locals encouraged the school to seek out a more reputable way of building a fortune.

Admission to the school is quite prestigious, as many noble and powerful houses view having a Westvalley graduate among their number as an essential requirement in polite society.

**Sneak Attack**:  While using a light weapon, when attacking a flatfooted opponent, or an enemy flanked by an ally, you may add 1d6 precision damage to your damage roll.

**Concealed Combat:**  You gain proficiency with the War Razor and sword cane. When attacking an opponent with a weapon that was concealed to them at the start of your turn, they are considered flat footed.  You treat the sword cane as a light weapon.

**Wet Neck:**  When making an attack roll, if the result of the roll is a natural 20, all sneak attack dice are treated as being rolled at their maximum value.  This increase occurs even if the threatened critical is not confirmed.
