The Island of Evef is often viewed by visitors as just one large city, but its suburbs are large and diverse enough that they function like separate cities.

The gnomes of Evef occup what is known as the Upper Spires.  There is a significant guild of craftsman here that study what they call Material Enhanced Engineering.  The craft of using simple magical enhancements along with simple machines to create complex and wonderous effects.  Not caring for the gnomish term, the dwarves simply refer to them as artificers and the world has come to know them as such.  

While the dwarfs have created magnificent halls beneath the rock for themselves, the gnomish artificers have crafted massive and seemingly impossible towers as houses on top of the island platue.

As gnomes have a tendency to get bored doing the same thing twice, their houses were never built straight or uniform. The two things most towers had in common was they were all largely the same crooked narrow circulare stairwell with a much larger house sitting on top the extremely tall structure. Occationally, every third or forth house, a tower built mostly of growing fruits and vegetables rose up as a virtical farm.

In addition, the city only regulated the ownership of the earth and didn't stop someone from buildilng a sprawling house stilted into the air, provided its base stayed on the owners lands.  This resulted in the gnomes of this city's greatest obsession, having a house or room that sees the sky, the horizon, and for the extremely ambitious, both.   

The most unforgettable sight of the upper spires are not the strange and bizzare architecture, but the canals of airships that fly between them, as well as the fleet of flying homes above.  Giving a ship permanent flight is a craft the gnomes have learned on a small scale quite some time ago, and it is considered one of the highest forms of their magical craft.  As such, the sky is full of a hodgepodge of strange flying ships, from the partially hollowed and stuffed fish Ms Fizzlebee rides to town, or the bathtub old man Hobbs takes to get his groceries.  A few of the stranger gnomes even use balloons and magical heat to accomplish a lesser effect.  As none of the airships they designed to sail over the seas have ever returned, it is considered one of their unmastered arts and is heavily studied.

While they exist, the gnomes of the upper spires rarely use their techniques to craft weapons or armor.  It is well within their abilities, and there are fine examples of their great works in the Evef royal armory.  Crafting normal armor is a simple and boring thing for them to do, so it rarely gets done outside of learning to do it.

Nearly all of the magically crafted and practical items in the city, such as the cannons that defend the walls of the sea ports, were created by dwarves who studdied with the gnomes and had the patience to make the same item more then once.

If you are an aspiring crafter and friend of the city who can put up with gnomish enthusiasm, you are likely to find a willing teacher in the upper spires.

**Weapon and Armor proficiency:**  At 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Gnome Pincher.  You gain no armor proficiency.

**Refined Alloys:**  You may use Craft Alchemy to refine any metal. Doing so with access to a forge requires no roll.  A makeshift forge can be crafted in around an hour and can be used for most materials at a DC of 25. The resulting alloy is half the weight and reduces any armor penalties by 1 per armor category if crafted into armor.

**Weapon Maintenence:**  The craftman of the island are in charge of maintaining the islands defensive operations, which is work that ultimately falls the newest of apprentinces.
The artificer gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger gains at first level. Like a Gunslinger, an artificer can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.

**Basic Automation:** You have learned to combine basic spells with objects rather then their intended target.  You may cast spells into objects as if they were creatures.  You may do this for any spells you cast that can target creatures, including personal spells.  While the spell is in effect, you have control of any effect as if you were the object.  Many young students are frustrated by the fact they have to make their devices move with their own will, which typically drives them to simplify their designs further.  
In addition, when imbueing a magical device with a scroll for a spell you do not know, you may use craft: automation with the magical emphasis instead of the normal use magical device skill, at the same DC.  

**Weapons and Such:**  An essential part of the school, due to the cities reliance on cannons to defend itself, you have learned to craft basic firearms and cannons, as well as turn them into arcane guns.  
For many reasons, your training begins with learning the spell Bullet Ward, at will, with a caster level equal to your hit dice.  
Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a user’s hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic.  
When crafting a firearm, you may imbue it with any spell you cast into it which has a ray, cone, line, or a single target(Ie, the spell must be aimed).  Melee touch spell can often be appropriate, but cant be triggered without a bullet.  
When activating the arcane gun, the weilder can choose to activate it as a magic item, such as a wand.  
Alternatively, the user may choose to fire the arcane gun and deliver the spell through the bullet.  If they choose to do this, they may add the gun’s enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the attack roll or to the spell’s saving throw DCs.  This functions like a magus's spellstrike, in that the weapon's crit range is used and the bullet's damage is dealt.  
Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells’ attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes.  
This functions like a magus's spellstrike, in that the weapon's crit range is used and the bullet's damage is dealt.  
When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger’s space (spellslinger’s choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.  The radius of the blast is 5 ft for every 2 spell levels of the spell.  
The firearm is otherwise crafted per a normal craft Firearms roll.  

To determine the effects of the imbued fireamr, select from the following craft: Firearms (magical) options:  
DC 15 + 5 per spell level creates a firearm with 1 charge per day of the spell cast into it.  
DC 20 + 10 per spell level creates a firearm with 3 charges per day  
DC 30 + 15 per spell level creates a firearm that always triggers that spell when fired.  
Regardless of the exact wording of the spell, the user of the weapon must succeed at a ranged touch attack with the weapon for the spell to directly hit, GM descretion on where and how the spell triggers on a miss.  The player can always choose to target a square at AC 5.  

The spell casting level for this spell is always equal to the activators caster level, and the DC is based on the ability score used to cast this spell into the object.  If the user is a gnome, they may substitute their character level for their caster level if they wish.


**Advanced Automation:** Objects that have been given a spell can now follow extremely simple commands, as though they were mindless undead. You may communicate telepathically or vocally, the object understands your will.

**Finding your obsession:**  If you spend any time with a gnomish teacher, you will find out quickly what they are obsessed about.  You will also learn they do not really understand how you lack them (assuming you do).  
What you are driven to craft the most typically guides which guild you are allowed into to study with. You may select one of the following guilds to work with to gain a deeper understanding of your skills:  
Guild of the Tower: Working with the craftsmen that create the strangely sturdy crooked towers, you have learned to refine metal into much stronger alloys. You may now refine metal to be one quarter its original weight and reduces any armor penalty by 2 per armor category if crafted into armor.  If crafted into a weapon, that weapon is treated as one step smaller. (2handed->1handed->light)  
Guild of Tinkerers: While watching a master tinkerer work, you noticed she was using the same scroll of light throughout her work.  Of all their techiniques this seemed the most worth learning.  When using a scroll or spell to imbue an item with a spell, you may roll spellcraft at a DC of 15+5 per spell level to not expend the spell.  
Guild of Wanderers: Some of the gnomes on this island can think of nothing other than the world beyond.  Through their inginuity, they have created magical items that allow the dwarven ships to sail open seas, but have still yet to master overseas flight.  You have learned to give command of one of your spells to an ally within 30 feet.  Doing this is a standard action.  If you do this for a spell cast on an object, the object also listens to the new controler of the spell and will follow simple commands like a mindless undead.
