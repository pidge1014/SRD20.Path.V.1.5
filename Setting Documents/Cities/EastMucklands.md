While the West Mucklands region is warm wet and swampy, the east region is known for its slightly drier marshes, which are still wet and quite often not warm.  The mountain air from the north keeps this region from ever getting too warm in the winter months, despite the strange magic at the heart of the Mucklands.

Due to the marshes, there are few who venture outside the roads here, which helps keep things safe.  Like all the Mucklands, the fey are numerous and mischevious here.  While they may not intend to seriously harm anyone, losing sight of the road is often a fatal mistake here.

Small settlements here all manage to keep themselves going just fine without any governements, provided there is a good witch in town.

There are three small cities of note in the East Mucklands.  Settlers Rest is the westernmost settlement of the region, and is sustained by the travelers through the region, as it is slightly more than halfway through the area and a good stopping point for anyone traveling by hippogryph or gryphon.

On the far north end of the marshes is a town known as Small Rock.  It rests about 10 miles south to the outermost gates to the Dwarven city of Mount Herbert and serves as the Clans gateway to the outer world.  For a city of less then 1000 people, a remarkable number of crafted wonders can be found here.

The coven of East Mucklands established the third settlement to the south, along the edge of the mountains. Here they found a stream of clean water, secured the entire mountain to ensure it couldnt be befouled easily, and over time, a small city was estabilshed known as Clear Water.

The coven spend some time ensuring nothing foul comes to live near their home, but mainly tend to local matters and help keep their flock healthy.  What sets these witches apart is their innate talents for doing so. 

East Muckland is not a weathly or religious area, but the witches have more then made up for their lack of clerics and alchemists.

**Bedside Manner:**  When a spell you cast causes healing, you may add your charisma modifier to the healing received.

**Self Taught Alchemist:** You gain the ability to create potions. You may create a potion from a witch spell you have prepared. Doing this takes ten minutes per spell level.  Creating the potion has no additional cost, apart from any components the spell may require.  If not used within 48 hours, the potion expires. Merchants have no interest in buying these, as the resulting potion is thick, muddy, and brown.

**Spiritually Self Reliant:** The Witches of this coven have learned a few tricks to help them make up for the lack of clerics in their home region.  You may select one spell on the druid spell list and add it to your witch spell list.
