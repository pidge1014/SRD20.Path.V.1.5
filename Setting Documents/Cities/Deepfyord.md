Established on the far side of the reminants of the ruined city of Godzer, the town of Deepfyord was built to both connect the the splinter to the rest of the world, and serve as an example of the type of city that can earn the alliegence of the great city in the Scar.

Most aspects of this city were well planned, partly resulting from the orderly priesthood that still runs most of the city's administration.  However, the actual day to day enforcement of law required a local civilian force, and that required the creation of a school to teach non lethal fighting.

Housed outside the town of Deepfyord, The School for the Gentlemanly Enforcement of Order trains a significant amount of the north coast's elite guards, in addition to the local force.  The graduates tend to serve as castle guards or personal escorts, as the general patrolmen are not worth the training investment for most rulers.

**Tools of the Trade:**  Few guardsman are lucky enough to face any true threat in their day to day lives, and are therefor forced to become proficient in the use of less than lethal weapons.

`	`Thanks for diligent practice and improved technique, when wielding a weapon with the non lethal property, you may treat it as one size larger for the purposes of damage.

**Takedown:** As a standard action, you may make a special grab attack with a melee weapon you are holding.

**Improvised restraints:**  When you start a turn grappling a creature, you may spend a full round action to securely tie them up.   There must be rope or suitable tying material within reach or on your person to preform this action.   Once accomplished, your target is considered helpless and immobilized, but may still preform purely mental actions.

**Shield Wall:**  While using a tower shield, you may add your shield bonus to your fortitude saves.
