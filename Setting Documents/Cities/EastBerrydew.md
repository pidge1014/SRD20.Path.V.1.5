The City of East Berrydew is a nice and pleasant city.  Keeping it that way is the eternal dream of the hafling citizens that fight along the western wall along the scar.  Unlike most of the world, the foul creatures of the scar can survive just fine in the Berrydew valley and this has greatly complicated the lives of the local gental folk.

The city of halflings is entirely populated by army veterans, as conscription is maditory for all citizens.  While the city is in many ways communist, in that food, farming, water, and housing are freely distributed to citizens, there are no rules or limits stopping someone from expanding their personal wealth.

The easiest way to find wealth in the city is to find something the halfings population finds delicious.  However, citizens that do grow wealthy in East Berrydew often find spending it in other cities to be far easier as the local food oriented tastes are limiting.  

The city is administered by a locally elected official.  They are allowed to serve once for nine years, unless removed before hand.  This almost never happens if the officials are not on their deathbed, and only once when a halfling by the name of Bimble Greenhill took a 14 hour nap and was unwakable durring a major town fire.

The Southern Bay of Berrydew has a surprisingly friendly population of sea hags.  To outsiders, mainly due to their non offensive appearance, they are often not even recognized as sea hags.  Some suspect their appearance and behavior is a natural result from naga experimentation.  The more superstitious speak of a truce after an ancient and great battle, some even leave offerings for the hags as thanks for honoring the treaty.

Like most of the Splinter, East Berrydew is spiritually protected by a coven of witches.

Over time, the local coven became friendly with the hags, and were even able to covertly recruit some to join their coven.  The techniques they taught each other have shaped themselves as much as their abilities.
