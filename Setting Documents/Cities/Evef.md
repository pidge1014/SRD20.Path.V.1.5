The Island nation of Evef was entirely unknown to the citizens of Flintfall's Splinter, including the nearby settlements of Ougin and Thistle Grove.  That is, until, a lost vessel that had originated in Evef drifted between the southern islands and was captured.  Amoung the many mechanical and magical treasures found, was a map that displayed the boats path, showing an island remarkably close.

An expedition was formed, and using the new technology found on board to navigate the sea, a small fleet left Thistle Grove with the hopes of finding the new land.

After a terrifying hour and a half out of the sight of shore, a massive cliffside appeared on the edge of the horizon.  As they got closer, they realized there was a massive murual carved into the cliff of dwarves fighting off tentacled creatures.  When they got far too close to turn back should the dwarves intend harm, they realized hidden into the carving were dwarven cannons and the largest battlements any of them had ever seen.  They were still in good shape, but the clear signs of battle are visible.

Thankfully for the expedition, the dwarves were happy to see their neighbors, who they had, of course, not forgotten about at all and sent a trading boat from time to time.

The mechanical devices, embedded with simple but effective spell work, found throughout their cities stunned the new visitors.  Mirrors and lenses bring the bright light of the sun into the many levels of caves and caverns connecting to the ports.  The cities above on the platue tower into the sky, with some levels of the cityscape floating in the sky.  Even to a citizen that lives in a world of magic, the city of Evef can seem beyond belief.

Home to mainly dwarves, there are a fair number of gnomes living throughout the island.  The gnomes specialize in airbound transport, although none of their airships, that were not attached to a dwarven fleet, have managed to return from their maden voyages yet.

Despite their mechanical and crafting prowess in the shop, the dwarves of Evef have a long reputation to the aversion of tools and metal objects whenever possible, and an a strange obsession with having the strongest fists.   Most speculate both arose out the saltstone ore their cliffsides are made of which is mine locally. The strange toxic ore must be mined by hand and fist, as it is known to rapidly corrode and decay both metal and wooden tools.

There are no schools in Evef to learn to fight like the locals.  One simply has to join the miners in the mine, and you will learn soon enough.

**Tough Fingers:**   While the mines toughen your hands during the day, the bars at night teach you to use them.  You gain the improved unarmed combat feat.  

**Barroom Fighting**:  While using a light weapon, when attacking a flatfooted opponent, or an enemy flanked by an ally, you may add 1d6 damage to your damage roll.  This is precision damage.

**Iron Lungs:**  The dangers of mining have taught you how to get to a safe place, before passing out.  Anytime you have to save vs an effect on your lungs, such as cloud kill or suffocate, whether you succeed or not on the saving throw, all effects on you are delayed by one turn.

**Piercing Strikes:** Any time you attack unarmed or with a weapon from the close group, you may add your dexterity modifier to the damage roll, in addition to your strength.

**Mine Sight:**  You have lived in the darkness for more hours than you'd care to remember.  Anytime you are without the use of your sight, you gain blind sense 15ft.
