The Ancient platues that Pimdak was built on have always possessed a quality that nullifies magic in the area.   The magic is not dispelled, but simply and thouroughly, supressed.  Magical creatures, items, spells, and talents people didnt realize came from the arcane powers of the world, all become mundane while on the great steppes.  
To this day, the mundane nature of life in Pimdak serves as a great equalizer between the magical powers of the world.

The Arbitors of Pimdak consists of representatives of each of the major clans that populate the City of Pimdak.  They serve as a council that resolves any dispute that occurs within the city.   The decisions are ratified with a simple majority vote and enforcement is left up to the clans.   Pimdak has no official laws, simply the will of the arbitors and the informal social ethics that guide there decisions.

As one might guess, this creates a system where if you are not a member of one of the 15 major clans in the city, you are living as a second class citizen in a lawless city.  It is especially unwise to visit alone if you are unfamiliar with the customs of the city, especially considering these proceedings are exclusively conducted in an ancient varient of the orcish language.

The arbitors themselves are often not the leader of the clans, as they have far more important things to do then manage the daily complaints of a city.

The strongest of the Clan's is known in common as "The Broken Axe", or "Bajrak Lagurz Sapat".  Their members run a school that teaches a local and brutal fighting techniques.  Anyone worthy, as judged by the school's teachers, is allowed to train with them.

The current list of Arbitors and their clans are as follows:
* **Ulam Lagurz Sapat** :**Broken Axe Clan (Lagurz Sapat)**
* **Gaakt Mor Shaugit** :**Black Arrow Clan (Mor Shaugit)**
* **Curbak Karn Kil**   :**Red Sky Clan(Karn Kil)**
* **Bog Gundum Kala**   :**The Standing Fortress Clan(Gundam Kala)**
* **Lash Fukisham Korlash**  :**Strong Jaw Clan(Fukisham Korlash)**
* **Shagar Farghat Ro**    :**Leaping Cloud Clan(Farghat Ro)**
* **Agrob Auga Roz**   :**Steady Eye Clan(Auga Roz)**
* **Shel Karn Doram**   :**Red Fist Clan(Karn Doram)**
* **Gul Lagurz Dha**   :**Shattered Earth Clan(Lagurz Dha)**
* **Rogmesh Fush Stuh**   :**Slow Storm Clan(Fush Stuh)**
* **Duluk Bumbullaum Zanalt**   :**Thunderous Sound Clan(Bumbullaum Zanalt)**
* **Farad Rum Dagronk**   :**Moving Passage Clan(Rum Dagronk)**
* **Orkid Kokan Lump**   :**Hammerfall Clan(Kokan Lump)**
* **Dery Lightfoot**     :**Lightfoot Clan (Draut Fra)** The only halfling clan in Pimdak, lightfoot clan has done well for themselves all things considered. The halflings are by far the most likely group to help out a stranger, but will not risk their status in the city for an outsider. Dery Lightfoot is a plesant, but cunning individual, rarely speaking at meetings without knowing exactly the impact of his words. He garners very little respect as a halfling, and instead relies on inspiring other members of the council to do his will without realizing an idea had started with the small folk.
* **Korguul Fark Goth**   :**The Masters of the Forge(Fark Goth)**


South of Pimdak, resides an ancient training site still being operated today.  Originally built by the naga, the orc's they trained here claimed it for themselves after the naga's collapse.  

This school continues to teach willing students who desire to defend the township of Pimdak their brutal techniques.  The orcs teach their students to learn to smash through their opponents defenses directly, rather than avoid them.

Graduates of the Great Plateau are terrifying in battle, as they often leave their enemies armor and weapons in as many pieces as their opponents.

**Cleave the Weak:**  When making a sunder attempt against an item with the fragile quality or primarily made of wood, such as a spear or glaive, your damage is doubled as if it was a critical hit.

**Mighty Sunder:** When making a sunder attempt against an opponents armor using a Flambard, you may choose to deal damage to both your opponent and their armor.  Damage is rolled once, and the hardess of the armor applies as normal.  The armor and the target then both take the remaining damage. DR applies as normal.
