**Nature Bond:**A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment.   


**Nature Sense**:Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.

**Wild empathy** : A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses

**Woodland Stride:** A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time.

**Wild Shape:** At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or plant type. This ability functions like the [**beast shape I**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape) spell or plant shape 1, except as noted here. 
The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to [**animal**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter

At 7th level, a druid may shapeshift into an animal one step different from its own and the version of beast and plant shape increase by one.  Both of these again increase by one at 13th level and every three levels thereafter.  


**Resist Nature's Lure:**  At 5th level, a druid gains a +3 bonus vs spells and spell like abilities cast by creatures of the fey sub-type.  This bonus also applies to all spells that target plants, such as entangle.  This increases by +3 every 5 levels thereafter.  

**Many Lives:**  Druids are fully committed to the karmic cycle of nature. At 6th level, if a druid is killed, she may automatically [*reincarnate*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reincarnate) (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using [*locate object*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-object) as a [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-). If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains [**dead**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) and does not [*reincarnate*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reincarnate). The many lives ability does not function if the reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect.

A druid cannot be raised from the [**dead**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.

**Venom Immunity:**  You are immune to all poison.

**Cheat Death:**  As a faithful servant to the natural order, you resist attempts to bypass it.  At 8th level, a druid may reroll a save against a death effect, [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels), or [**necromancy**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy) effect before the result of the roll is revealed, or reroll a failed stabilization check while [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying). She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll.
At 8th level, a druid may use this once per day, and an additional time every 6 levels thereafter.

**Living speech:**  A druid is capable of communicating with any living creature, up to the limits of the creatures intelligence.  This functions as true speech, but for living creatures only.

**Dragon Shape:** At 10th level, she can spend two uses of [wild shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-)** to transform into a [Medium](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/medium) **[**dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon)** as per [*form of the dragon I*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/form-of-the-dragon-i) **.**   At 13th level, and every three levels thereafter, the druid may increase the size of the dragon and increase the version of form of the dragon.   A druid may only assume the form of dragons that appear naturally in the world.
