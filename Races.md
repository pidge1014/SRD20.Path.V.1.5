**Races: (note, lots of work left here)**

Characters start with a pool of 20 Character Points, which may be spent on any racial traits or regional traits your character is eligible for.  How you spend this pool represents both who your character was born as, and how society shaped them until this point. 

Traits cost 3 Character points unless otherwise noted on the trait.   While there are very few written restrictions in traits, they should be selected to represent a character and anything contradictory can be denied per GM discretion.  

**Ability Score Modifiers**.  Each race has the option to select alternate ability score modifiers. However, doing so indicates you are just a little bit less like your ancestors than your contemporaries.  For this reason, choosing to select your own ability score modifiers has a 4 character point cost.  

When you select this option, you may select any ability score modifiers, positive or negative, and replace the abilities they apply to.  The bonuses must still apply to a unique ability.

- **Surface Survivalist**: Some dwarves have dwelt so long above ground they have lost their ability to see at night. However, their adaptation to extreme environments allows them to treat wind conditions (when determining whether or not they are checked or blown away) and either hot or cold climates (choose one) as one step less severe. This can not be taken with [darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision).

If a dwarf with this trait notices a [Sleight of Hand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand) attempt to steal from him and the dwarf is not [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) or has [Combat Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat), the attempt triggers an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from that dwarf.
- **Treasure Sense (4 CP)**: Some dwarves have learned to sense the presence of material wealth with dragonlike precision. This ability functions as [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent), except it can detect only precious metals (copper, silver, and gold) and creatures primarily made of such materials.
- **Xenophobic**: Isolationist dwarves despise non-dwarven [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid).

In addition, they learn only one language per 2 ranks of [Linguistics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics) they possess. However, their untrusting nature gives them a +1 bonus against mind-affecting effects, except for [*fear*](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear) affects.
- **Wanderer(5 CP)** You gain [Endurance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/endurance) as a bonus feat, and [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) and [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) are class skills for them.


**Elf**

Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.

While Elves can be found in most cities across the continent, the vast majority prefer to live in their cities in the forests. Outsiders are very often welcome in these cities, but few are found there. Most who return say the dramatic difference in lifestyles was simply too much.

**Gnomes**

Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.

Every great civilization on the continent can count gnomes among them, although there are no large gnomish cities.  If there ever was a great gnomish civilization, it has been  lost to time, or possibly to its administrators.

Gnomes take great delight in life, and while you would think such a long lived species would have patience, it is quite the opposite.  500 years isn't half the time needed to see The Continent, so if something isn't enjoyable to them, its unlikely the a gnome will bother.

**Clockwork Folk**

For centuries of existence, before the afterlives existed, souls had no where to go after death without magical intervention.  Most lacked the means to afford a second life of their choice and, as a result, the world was flooded with wandering souls.  

That was until an enterprising wizard by the name of Philip Huygens who studied the druid's ability to magically reincarnate souls and wrote a series of texts on the nature of magic, souls, and the physical world.  These texts ultimately became the basis for a method to provide a willing soul with a constructed body and a new life.

Philip, a good person by nature, refused to test this on anyone but himself and thankfully his theories proved correct.  Unfortunately, like all clockwork beings and truly reincarnated souls, all his memories were lost in the process.  Philip, the clockwork man of Farfell Arcane University, is the oldest known living creature on the continent.

Today, few clockwork folk are created as they are expensive and most prefer to pass on to the afterlives. The average age of a clockwork folk is 1400 years old.
