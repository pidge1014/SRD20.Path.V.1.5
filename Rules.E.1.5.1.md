**Modified Rules:**

**Base Classes:**  You can not take more that 12 total levels in base classes.

**Self Study Levels:**  Instead of pursuing a prestige class or other base classes, you may choose to focus on self study and improve the skills you already possess.  If you choose to do this, you may select two additional class features you possess, they increase in level as if they were ingrained.  

You gain hit dice, BAB, and saves, equal to the amount gained from the class in which you have the most levels.  If it is a tie, you may select your choice of hit dice, BAB or Save Progression.  These choices do not need to all be from the same class.  Unlike an ingrained class feature, the two features you select do not need to be from favored classes and you do not need to have 3 levels of that class.

**Favored Class:**  In addition to the listed bonuses, for every three levels you gain in a favored class you may declare one of its class features, which you possess, an ingrained class feature.  When you gain levels in any class, an ingrained feature is treated as if you had gained another level of your favored class.
For example, a 3rd level wizard with a favored class of wizard can declare their spell casting as their ingrained feature, then take 10 levels of fighter and still gain spells and casting levels as a 13th level wizard.

You can not have more than 3 ingrained class features.

**Prestige classes:**  Any prestige class that provides +1 spell casting levels instead may be applied to class levels for another class feature, assuming spell casting is already selected as an ingrained feature.  The class feature selected must still be from a favored class.

**Positive/Negative Energy (setting rule):**  As noted in the cleric class, in addition to undead, creatures that come from planes in the Lower Pantheon are also healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy (Demons, devils, etc).  They are still considered living creatures.

**Common Spell Level:**  Any time spell levels are compared, the common spell level is used for comparison in place of the actual spell level it was cast at.**  
This is to maintain consistent effects and rules with spell interactions, even if a class may have early or late access to the spells in question, or meta-magic has been used.
Calculating common spell level is done by averaging the existing spell levels and rounding up.

**Maintaining A Grapple:**  You no longer need to spend an action at the start of your turn to maintain a grapple.   To simplify the system, if the target of your grapple is still grappled at the start of your turn, then it's considered to be successfully maintained triggering any related effects.  

**Multi-classing:**  Base classes only provide weapon and armor proficiency if taken at character level 1.   Prestige classes provide any proficiency mentioned regardless of character level. You gain the class skills of any class you join.

**Buckler is re-written :**

Buckler:
**Benefit**: This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also wield a weapon using the arm the buckler is strapped to, but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you attack with any arm a buckler is strapped to, you lose the buckler’s [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) bonus until the start of your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components as well with this arm, but you lose the buckler’s [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) bonus until your next turn if you do.

You can’t make a shield bash with a buckler.

**Animal Companions**

Animal companions function as written in P1E, except as noted below.

**HD**

Animal companions now gain 1 hit dice every level, starting with 1 hit dice at level 1. However, the dice they gain is dependent upon their size.  When an animal companion increases in size and gains a larger hit dice, the increase is not retroactive but does apply for the level in which the increase occurred.

Tiny HD: 1d4
Small HD: 1d6
Medium HD: 1d8
Large HD:1d10
Huge HD:1d12

**BAB**

An animal companion's ability in combat is closely tied to the training they receive and the fighting talent of their master.  As a result, an animal companion gains the same BAB as their master when they gain a level.

In the case of boon companion, the BAB gained is equal to the first four levels(or less) of the class that first granted the animal companion class feature.


**Combat CR adjustments from Pathfinder 1E:**

Starting Difficulty: CR = Party level x 1.5 for standard difficulty.  Add up to half party level in CR to increase.

SR, All Saves, CMD : apply penalty to all equal to half the party level

**New/Modified Feats:**
**Special focus(general), new** : 	**Requirements**: 1 ingrained class feature  

`				`**Benefit:** You may ingrain a class feature from a class you have three 					levels in, but is not a favored class.

**All feats that require BAB** : Character level may be used in place of base attack bonus for the purposes of qualifying for feats.

**Modified/New Spells:**

Freedom of Movement - *Modified*

level: 2  

Freedom of movement now only applies to physical restrictions and does not impact conditions resulting from spells and supernatural abilities.

Freedom of Movement(Greater)  *- NEW*

Level 6 spell, ranger/bard/inquisitor 4

Duration 1 round/level

Applies to both magical and physical restrictions to attacks and movement.

(works as written in 1E and negates anything that would impair attacking or movement)

Permanency - *Modified*

*new description:*

This spell makes the duration of certain other spells permanent. First the desired spell must be cast separately and then follow it with the *permanency* spell.

You must have a minimum caster level of 4 times the spell level of the desired spell and the spell must have a duration of at least 1 minute/level. You do not, however, need to cast the spell at a caster level of 4 times the spell.

You do not need to have cast the spell being made permanent, but if your caster level is different than the other caster, the lower of the two is applied to the permanent spell for any effects related to caster level.

In addition, permanency has a component cost equal to 2500 gold per spell level of the spell being made permanent or 1000 gold per caster level, whichever is higher.

Magic Jar *- Modified:*

As 3.0

True seeing *- Modified:*

Only negates illusion spells of a lower level.  Illusion spells of an equal or higher common spell level function as normal.

True seeing (greater)  *- NEW*

Level 9 spell  *(8 cleric, 9 wizard, 10 druid)*
duration 1 round /level

Functions as we treat true seeing in P.1E, but also allows the user to see anyone trying to hide with stealth or by only existing partially in the plane, such as shadow walk.

Slay Living *- Modified*
